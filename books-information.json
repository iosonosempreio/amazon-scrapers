[{"title":"How To Stop Your Doctor Killing You","description":"For over 20 years this massive international bestseller has been widely praised by caring doctors.Bestselling author Dr Vernon Coleman MB ChB DSc FRSA was the first doctor to point out that doctors are now one of the top three causes of death - along with cancer and heart disease and to describe the role of the immune system in the development of cancer. In this book he explains that the person most likely to kill you is not a burglar, a mugger, a deranged relative or a drunken driver. The facts show that the person most likely to kill you is your doctor. This classic book explains how to protect yourself from this serious threat to your life. There are sections on tests and investigations, drugs, repeat prescriptions, mental health care, alternative medicine, cancer, healthy eating, self-healing, breast cancer scandals, the danger of too many X rays, benzodiazepine tranquillisers, blood cholesterol (and drugs used for lowering it) and the danger of side effects. There are chapters on: How to survive in hospital; Questions to ask before taking a prescribed drug; How to get the best out of your doctor; Ten good reasons why you shouldn't trust your doctor and How to read your prescription. There is advice on second opinions and how to make sure your doctor doesn't bully you.

This has been perpetrated by the systematic, ongoing falsification of history in much the same way as perpetrated by the powers that be in the suspiciously prophetic novel '1984', by George Orwell. We have all been deceived on a monumental scale by a tiny clique of people who by their own birthright and bloodlines absolutely believe that they have the divine right to rule over us by whatever method best suits their purposes. In order to achieve this they have lied, deceived, murdered and even committed genocide down the millennia in an attempt to bring their ultimate goal to fruition. Find out about the use of drugs, vaccinations, micro-chipping, mind control, trans-humanism and 24/7 distractions such as non-stop sports, entertainments and the invasive 'celebrity culture' that attempts to pervade our whole lives.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/146-6980279-5852566?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Social-Sciences-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/146-6980279-5852566?ie=UTF8&node=3377866011"},{"category":"Politics & Government","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Government/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/146-6980279-5852566?ie=UTF8&node=5571255011"}],"asin":"1291419438","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1291419438","reviews":{"total_reviews":313,"rating":"4.4","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":946751,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":1039,"category":"Government Social Policy","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/10771/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":1518,"category":"Sociology of Class","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/271633011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":123862,"category":"History","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/9/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XL+8QlKzL.jpg","total_images":3,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XL+8QlKzL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71MhQX0tbBL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31zPgSBIr+L.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"Arrives:  Jan 12 - 20 ","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"2.34 pounds","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"lulu.com (May 14, 2013)","paperback":"734 pages","ISBN-10":"1291419438","ISBN-13":"978-1291419436","qty_per_order":30,"store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[{"asin":"2940631123","title":"COVID-19: The Great Reset","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-j1meObYL._AC_UL160_SR104,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/2940631123/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":3.65879},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"1098329864","title":"Number Games: 9/11 to Coronavirus","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hH78eZT4L._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1098329864/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.95114},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"0970312598","title":"Propaganda","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81XIkANlwgL._AC_UL160_SR102,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0970312598/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.651413},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"1094818747","title":"JFK ‚Äì A Very British Coup: The Definitive Truth of the Assassination","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qjCZOlN%2BL._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1094818747/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":3.6515},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"1645020096","title":"The Invisible Rainbow: A History of Electricity and Life","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61JYIQ6qtqL._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1645020096/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.851018},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"1091757712","title":"Anyone Who Tells You Vaccines Are Safe and Effective is Lying","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ckFDsSWyL._AC_UL160_SR129,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1091757712/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.75774},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}}],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"John Hamer","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/John-Hamer/e/B00B8X4CB6/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"}]},{"title":"COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science","description":"Separating FACT from FICTION in the COVID-19 EpidemicPeople are afraid. COVID-19 has upended our lives as it poses new medical dangers, economic suffering and grave uncertainty about the world around us. The collateral damage is enormous, but politics invade perception. There are so many unknowns. Does a treatment work? Is a vaccine coming? How likely are you to catch COVID and how can you best protect yourself and your family? What are the real risks and what is hysteria? Where are our fear leaders? What are their agendas?From Fox News Medical Contributor and the author of¬†False Alarm (Wiley, 2008) comes¬†COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science¬†by Marc Siegel, M.D. This shocking expos√© of the facts as the media covers the national pandemic news and spread of the invisible virus reinforces the notion that we must arm ourselves against fear tactics that limit our abilities to safely make decisions and protect our families in a world of uncertainty.Life for citizens of the developed world before the pandemic was safer, easier, and healthier than for any other people in history thanks to modern medicine, science, technology, and intelligence‚Äì‚Äîbut COVID-19 has stolen that security and our nation's peace of mind. Now there is a pandemic virus, as well as a crippling epidemic of fear sweeping America. Why? The answer, according to nationally renowned health commentator Dr. Marc Siegel, is that we already lived in an artificially created culture of fear that was just waiting to be unleashed. In¬†COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science, Siegel identifies three major catalysts of the culture of fear: government, the media, and our own psyche. With fascinating, blow-by-blow analyses of the most sensational false alarms of the past few years, compounded now by the worst contagion of our lifetimes, he shows how fear mongers manipulate our most primitive instincts‚Äîoften without our even realizing it. COVID¬†shows us how to look behind the hype and hysteria, inoculate ourselves against these crippling fear tactics, and develop the emotional and intellectual skills needed to take back our lives, even as we battle the pandemic itself.¬†Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/146-2760109-9346622?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Medical Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/146-2760109-9346622?ie=UTF8&node=173514"},{"category":"Medicine","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medicine-Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/146-2760109-9346622?ie=UTF8&node=265542"}],"asin":"B08F2T79JH","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F2T79JH","reviews":{"total_reviews":143,"rating":"4.6","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":25696,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":6,"category":"Media & Internet in Politics","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/11650896011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":10,"category":"Communicable Diseases","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157190011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":24,"category":"Media & Internet in Politics","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/11764688011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41snpuSsCxL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41snpuSsCxL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Turner (October 13, 2020)","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[{"asin":"B00DNL355U","title":"False Alarm: The Truth about the Epidemic of Fear","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KUTV5Wc7L.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR104,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DNL355U/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.55199},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08P3T15PW","title":"Unreported Truths About Covid-19 and Lockdowns: Part 3: Masks","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0PMEys9L.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3T15PW/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.851453},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08F7W9276","title":"Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 2: Update and Examination of Lockdowns as a Strategy","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vKHT8sPbL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F7W9276/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.852587},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08DHMYQNK","title":"Scamdemic -

The roll out of their well-tested battlefield weapons system known as 5G represents the pinnacle in their use of electro-magnetic frequencies to literally remote control what these feudalists have for 8,000 years seen as their human herd. Since their intervention in Sumeria, these hybrid fallen angel Nephilim have usurped, steered and plundered all of Creation as self-appointed god/kings. The coming 5G apocalypse represents an opportunity for a great unveiling ‚Äì the Greek meaning of ‚Äúapocalypse‚Äù - of not only their nefarious 5G deception, but of the fraudulent Nephilim Crown itself. This book is written with the hope that it contributes to this great unveiling so that humanity will seize this moment not just to stop the 5G fourth industrial revolution of the Fourth Reich, but to emancipate itself from its Crown overlords.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Kindle Store","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/142-5609877-3082042?ie=UTF8&node=133140011"},{"category":"Kindle eBooks","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/142-5609877-3082042?ie=UTF8&node=154606011"},{"category":"Nonfiction","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Nonfiction-eBooks-Kindle/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/142-5609877-3082042?ie=UTF8&node=157325011"}],"asin":"B07V8M4B4L","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V8M4B4L","reviews":{"total_reviews":161,"rating":"4.4","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":343191,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":92322,"category":"Nonfiction","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157325011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Br9kf2VIL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Br9kf2VIL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[{"asin":"B07DJYTKG8","title":"Illuminati Agenda 21: The Luciferian Plan to Destroy Creation","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/718bI8AjTZL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJYTKG8/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.45156},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B008D69ASQ","title":"Stickin' it to the Matrix","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71myTKefe6L.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008D69ASQ/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.5534},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B0050YYZSY","title":"Big Oil & Their Bankers In the Persian Gulf: Four Horsemen, Eight Families and Their Global Intelligence, Narcotics and‚Ä¶","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61HLQnIPRDL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR106,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0050YYZSY/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.6569},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B00ICYL992","title":"The Federal Reserve Cartel","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zt8JbIN5L.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR116,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ICYL992/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.5533},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B084SQHNY5","title":"REBEL GENE: Secret Space and the Future of Humanity","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81NSTa062wL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR100,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084SQHNY5/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.65293},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B0050YYYQM","title":"The Grateful Unrich: Revolution in 50 Countries","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61F3h3tSwtL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR106,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0050YYYQM/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.257},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}}],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Dean Henderson","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Dean-Henderson/e/B008E6QB5K/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1"}]},{"title":"COVID-19: A Devil's Choice: How We Got Here. How We'll Get Out","description":"Dissenting Voices‚Äîan Imprint of Abundant World Institute‚Äîis dedicated to helping create and foster the conditions that enable human flourishing and abundance everywhere. To these ends, we seek to inspire, inform, educate, encourage, enable, and support the application of critical thinking, imagination, and innovation to global challenges. Today, the COVID-19 pandemic is one global grand challenge that is on everyone's mind, and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. It is a topic rife with confusion, fear, misinformation, competing agendas, and toxic politicization‚Äîall of which confound efforts at reaching anything resembling consensus on strategies and solutions. The new eBook, COVID-19: A Devil's Choice, helps us to make sense of it all. The product of intense investigations by award-winning author, technologist, and futurist, John Schroeter, the book is informed by respected medical professionals, documents provided by WHO, the CDC, and other original sources that validate the book's surprising, counterintuitive, and sometimes shocking findings. The book reveals not only the little-reported science related to the coronavirus, but the irreconcilable goals of various groups vying to capitalize on the pandemic to advance their respective objectives. Equally important, it shows that we have a choice about which version of the future will ultimately prevail, and precisely how a pandemic can be exploited to further well-meaning but misguided, or even nefarious, ends.Presented in 100 succinctly-stated arguments or &#8220;points,&#8221; A Devil's Choice illuminates the true nature of the coronavirus pandemic, who and what is behind it, what we can expect, and what we can do. The book concludes with an extensive Q&A with Jane M. Orient, M.D., executive director of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons.Dr. Sanjiv Chopra, Professor of Medicine and former Faculty Dean Continuing Education, Harvard Medical School, says, &#8220;John Schroeter has just brilliantly succeeded in [this] venture. Kudos to him for masterfully penning this. This a must read. I was most informed and inspired.&#8221; Dr. Simon Thornley, Public Health Physician, lecturer and researcher in the section of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at The University of Auckland, NZ, adds, &#8220;In this thoughtful book, John Schroeter does an excellent job of distilling the science that is not being heard. It is a much needed counter to the doomsday narrative that we've all been fed. This book gives me renewed hope for our future.&#8221; David L. Katz, MD, says of the book, &#8220;The paths to total harm minimization are illuminated by thinking past the simplistic reflexive responses, considering options both intuitive and otherwise. Well informed consensus is good; premature consensus is the death of insight.&#8221;Professor Karol Sikora, MA, PhD, concludes, &#8220;John's text illuminates the clear path forward. Let's follow the path he plots and move forward in a safe and yet ambitious way.&#8221;Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/141-7881375-6710550?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Medical Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/141-7881375-6710550?ie=UTF8&node=173514"},{"category":"Medicine","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medicine-Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/141-7881375-6710550?ie=UTF8&node=265542"}],"asin":"B08CR7RXHX","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CR7RXHX","reviews":{"total_reviews":19,"rating":"5.0","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":101398,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":17,"category":"Epidemiology","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157191011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":31,"category":"Communicable Diseases","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157190011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":83,"category":"Epidemiology","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/227208/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Mxse7pgYL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Mxse7pgYL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"John August Media, LLC (July 9, 2020)","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[{"asin":"B08L86WQHJ","title":"Brainwashed: Cutting Through the COVID Confusion","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/619HwjJywuL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR124,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L86WQHJ/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":5.057},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08DHMYQNK","title":"Scamdemic - The COVID-19 Agenda: The Liberal's Plot To Win The White House","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716zbWNLbUL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DHMYQNK/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.6595},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08K7QFNK4","title":"Liberty or Lockdown","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zQSt--fEL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K7QFNK4/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.8546},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08HR6X347","title":"Corona 911 : The Dark Weapons Backchannel To Pakistan And China From The US Congress","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81m-JRI9sdL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HR6X347/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":3.9546},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08P3T15PW","title":"Unreported Truths About Covid-19 and Lockdowns: Part 3: Masks","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0PMEys9L.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3T15PW/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.851453},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08JCDV25M","title":"Corona, False Alarm?: Runaway International Bestseller!","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YRUShwCSL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR104,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JCDV25M/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.75879},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}}],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"John Schroeter","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/John-Schroeter/e/B001KD5AEC/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1"}]},{"title":"The Coronavirus Deception: Confessions of a Dying Man","description":"In 2019, Coronavirus was released on the world.

In Vaccine-nation, Moritz unravels the mother of all vaccine lies - that vaccines are safe and they prevent disease. Furthermore, he reveals undeniable scientific proof that vaccines are actually implicated in most common diseases today. This book reveals: ‚Ä¢ Statistical evidence that vaccines never actually eradicated infectious diseases, including polio. ‚Ä¢ How childhood vaccines, flu shots and other kinds of inoculations systemically destroy the body's immune system. ‚Ä¢ The massive increase of allergies, Eczema, Arthritis, Asthma, Autism, Acid reflux, Cancer, Diabetes (infant and childhood), Kidney disease, Miscarriages, many Neurological and Autoimmune diseases, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is largely due to vaccines. ‚Ä¢ Why vaccinated children have 120% more Asthma, 317% more ADHD, 185% more Neurologic disorders, and 146% more Autism than those not vaccinated. ‚Ä¢ The shocking fact that most outbreaks of infectious diseases occur largely among those who are fully vaccinated. ‚Ä¢ Vaccines lack long-term safety testing and most vaccine side-effects are never reported to protect vaccine-makers from liability suits. For many decades we have all been led to believe that vaccines have eradicated the most dreaded infectious diseases, including polio, although to this day there is no scientific evidence to support this theory. On the other hand, indisputable scientific data reveal that childhood vaccines, flu shots and other kinds of inoculations are responsible for the dramatic decline of natural immunity among millions of children, adults, and members of the older population. With each new shot received, the immune system becomes weaker and permanently damaged, thereby laying the ground for potentially debilitating illnesses to develop in the future. Reaching deep into the vaccine cartel, Moritz uncovers hard facts to prove that profit - not public health - is the sole motive behind the vaccine-pushers' chicanery. In this book, he also digs up the real reasons behind the 2009 swine flu outbreak or the \"pandemic that didn't pan out\". In Vaccine-nation, Moritz minces no words while unraveling these and other skeletons in Big Pharma's closet and cautions you not to buy into the hollow claims of vaccine makers. In his characteristic style, Moritz offers a gentle and practical approach to a disease-free life, which rests on the fulcrum of the mind-body connection, cleansing of the body, and naturally healthy living.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/147-0120423-2920816?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Medical Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/147-0120423-2920816?ie=UTF8&node=173514"},{"category":"Medicine","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medicine-Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/147-0120423-2920816?ie=UTF8&node=265542"}],"asin":"0984595422","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0984595422","reviews":{"total_reviews":91,"rating":"4.7","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":409389,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":145,"category":"Vaccinations","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13922584011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":432,"category":"Communicable Diseases","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/227207/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jBA+wDVeL.jpg","total_images":2,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jBA+wDVeL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31ANs1q6anL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"Arrives:  Jan 29 - Feb 24 ","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"15.4 ounces","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Ener-chi.com (March 1, 2011)","paperback":"296 pages","ISBN-10":"0984595422","ISBN-13":"978-0984595426","qty_per_order":30,"store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[{"asin":"0984595449","title":"The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81WwK4G3jqL._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0984595449/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.6574},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"0989258750","title":"Cancer Is Not a Disease - It's a Healing Mechanism","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vcM39jB4L._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0989258750/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.55125},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"097927575X","title":"Timeless Secrets of Health and Rejuvenation, 4th Edition","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91OCramHxnL._AC_UL160_SR118,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/097927575X/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.75504},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"0979275733","title":"Heal Yourself with Sunlight","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51InkAYP9qL._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0979275733/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.5564},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"0976571536","title":"Lifting the Veil of Duality","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ku1tJq7FL._AC_UL160_SR108,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0976571536/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.6598},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"0976794454","title":"Heart Disease No More!","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517J3YJDAML._AC_UL160_SR100,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0976794454/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.959},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}}],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Andreas Moritz","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Andreas-Moritz/e/B001JRVA3E/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"}]},{"title":"Ending Plague: A Scholar's Obligation in an Age of Corruption (Children‚Äôs Health Defense)","description":"From the authors of the¬†New York Times¬†bestselling¬†Plague of Corruption¬†comes the prescription on how to end the plague infecting our medical community.Ending Plague continues the New York Times bestselling team of Dr. Judy A. Mikovits and Kent Heckenlively with legendary scientist, Dr. Francis W. Ruscetti joining the conversation. Dr. Ruscetti is credited as one of the founding fathers of human retrovirology. In 1980, Dr. Ruscetti‚Äôs team isolated the first pathogenic human retrovirus, HTLV-1. Ruscetti would eventually go on to work for thirty-eight years at the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Ruscetti was deeply involved in performing some of the most critical HIV-AIDS research in the 1980s, pioneered discoveries in understanding the workings of the human immune system in the 1990s, isolating a new family of mouse leukemia viruses linked to chronic diseases in 2009, and offers his insights into the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In 1991, Ruscetti received the Distinguished Service Award from the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Ruscetti offers a true insider‚Äôs portrait of nearly four decades at the center of public health. His insights into the successes and failures of government science will be eye-opening to the general public. You will read never-before-revealed information about the personalities and arguments which have been kept from view behind the iron curtain of public health. Can we say our scientists are protecting us, or is another agenda at work? For most of his decades at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Ruscetti has been in almost daily contact with his long-time collaborator, Dr. Mikovits, and their rich intellectual discussions will greatly add to our national discussion. Science involves a rigorous search for truth, and you will come to understand how science scholars are relentless in their quest for answers.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/131-3932521-4707843?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Biographies-Memoirs-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/131-3932521-4707843?ie=UTF8&node=2"},{"category":"Professionals & Academics","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Professionals-Academics-Biographies-Memoirs-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/131-3932521-4707843?ie=UTF8&node=2419"}],"asin":"1510764682","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1510764682","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0,"answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":79780,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":17,"category":"AIDS","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/4657/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":34,"category":"Virology","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/16311221/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":261,"category":"Scientist Biographies","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/2426/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a-bEmPIPL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71a-bEmPIPL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"1.74 pounds","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Skyhorse (April 6, 2021)","hardcover":"240 pages","ISBN-10":"1510764682","ISBN-13":"978-1510764682","qty_per_order":"na","store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Dr. Francis W.

You will understand how to decode it, prevent it, counter it, and help eliminate it from your life and from society, in turn doing your part in making a better world.You will further understand a higher decoding, for which the Social Programming Institute (The SPI) has termed as Bio-Digital Social Programming, that is used in a hybrid way, penetrating your defenses in order to rape you in sub-conscious, unconscious and conscious automated ways.This rape is termed Bio-Digital Hybrid Sexual Assault, that penetrates your Bio-Digital Field and is rampant with Smart Phones, Apps, IoT devices and AI, as it utilizes a certain frequency that replicates in the human body, your nervous system, cells, and even impacts your DNA. The bio-digital mind of a rapist bio-digitally crosses through content provided by Hollywood, Media, Music, Dance and the Education System. This mind has been termed Rape-Mind, as we have discovered bio-metric technologies that show and decode its very building blocks comprised of bio-digital fields and bio-matter. The investigator at The SPI has invested more than 20 years of research on the Human Bio-Digital Network, and its interconnectivity with the internet, culture and governing platforms. This book contains interviews of men that slept with 200 to 5,000 girls. Girls and women from young ages to very old were interviewed and the intelligence gathered incorporates scientific methods that include AI algorithms in conjunction with contemporary culture, media, industry, and issues related to mind-body health, growth and well-being. The book starts with interviews with victims, then takes you through a very brief history of rape and how it has transitioned to Bio-Digital Social Programming with Rape Automation that controls humanity today in imperceptible ways.Then it transitions to how new technology led by AI and Automation is actually fostering rape, sex crimes and human trafficking at a global scale outnumbering all of the war-time rapes combined. The victims are not simply girls or women, but all men as well.The concepts of Rape-Mind, Bio-Digital Network, Bio-Matter and Replication will be elaborated as it pertains to Rape in a multitude of ways. This is a must read for anyone interested in a meaningful relationship, and anyone who is a parent, a sister, a brother, a daughter, family, in law enforcement, in the tech industry, in education, in the media or government.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Kindle

We will cover present, emerging and future threats of Artificial Intelligence with Big Tech, including technology that can be used for assassination or to control humanities ability to have free formed thoughts without AI Bio-Digital Social Programming. The book will cover Cyborgs, Super Intelligence and how it can form, and in what ways it can travel undetected through The AI Global Network as it connects with the internet and the Human Bio-Digital Network. Companies such as Huawei, Facebook, Megvii Face++ and Google will be discussed. Over 50 entities will be explained and their interconnection with China. China, through Huawei is laying the foundation to deploy AI, Machines, Robotics via the 5G network. They can enslave humankind through an Orwellian Surveillance State.This book takes you in a simple way to understand what is Artificial Intelligence, and step by step, it takes the average reader through a process to understand very difficult concepts in a simplistic way. Every human being has the same brain, and same capacity to access abilities to think deep, and have insights that can better our world, in a safe way. The AI Organization hopes, the common person understands the coming age of AI, Robotics and 5G, and the dangers it poses as well as the positives. We also hope, scientists and big tech take one step back and think to innovate AI, in a more responsible fashion using an algorithm that takes every possible angle into consideration, to safeguard life. We will discuss what type of risk management and the components of this algorithm in the book, as well as the cultural aspects of AI. This AI book is meant to safeguard humanities interest, and we hope it receives acceptance from all people, may you be liberal, conservative, religious, atheist, the government, media or just a scientist doing what you cherish.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Kindle Store","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/132-8636074-1499460?ie=UTF8&node=133140011"},{"category":"Kindle eBooks","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/132-8636074-1499460?ie=UTF8&node=154606011"},{"category":"Computers & Technology","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Computers-Technology-Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/132-8636074-1499460?ie=UTF8&node=156116011"}],"asin":"B07ZDK442Q","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZDK442Q","reviews":{"total_reviews":92,"rating":"4.7","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":193117,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":16,"category":"Machine Theory","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/16977184011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":17,"category":"Computer Information Theory","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/16977183011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":19,"category":"Robotic Engineering","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157741011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51c85DvLIXL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51c85DvLIXL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"The AI Organization (October 20, 2019)","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"The AI Organization","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_1?ie=UTF8&field-author=The+AI+Organization&text=The+AI+Organization&sort=relevancerank&search-alias=digital-text"},{"author":"Cyrus Parsa","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_2?ie=UTF8&field-author=Cyrus+Parsa&text=Cyrus+Parsa&sort=relevancerank&search-alias=digital-text"}]},{"title":"The Covid Conspiracies: Book 1 Lockdown","description":"All experience is preceded by mind,Led by mind,Made by mind.Speak or act with a troubled mind,And suffering followsAs the wagon wheel follows the hoof of the ox.All experience is preceded by mind,Led by mind,Made by mind.Speak or act with a peaceful mind, And happiness follows,Like a never-departing shadow.The Dhammapada ‚ÄúSocial control is best managed through fear.‚Äù‚Äî Michael CrichtonDo you have any clue what is coming? Do you? I‚Äôd know if you told me what you thought of the two above quotes. Then I‚Äôd know what you think.What do you see in your Covid future? How does your heart feel? How is your mind set? Do you harbour Orwellian dystopian thoughts of Big Brother and control? Do you believe they are taking everything you have, and everything you are? If you think, that despite our situation, our salvation is truly at hand either by Global Billionaires or Conglomerates, whatever their motives, guilt re past misdemeanours or culpability then I salute you. The world will be good for you. And if you believe that salvation is at hand through another global power, the forces of nature, Mother Earth, Gaia, then again, I salute you. You are at one with the planet.But if your heart is heavy and your mind low; If you believe that Covid-19 has wrenched something from you; ripped something out of you , stolen your dreams and desires, your hopes and aspirations then this book is truly for you. It not only shows you the truth of things, a truth which will free you from all fear. it will help you to live in these Covid times in happiness and freedom and these in turn lead to great things for you. Why did I write this as a factional series? Because even the fiction contained herein could be true. The facts of Covid already cannot be completely pinned down and the world is awash with all kinds of claims and counterclaims. Plus, recall, already fades. Meanwhile conspiracy fiction is spreading like a toxic gas cloud poisoning minds; it could even be poisoning yours or just adding to the dose. Follow the twisting path that this series takes you on and you will at the very least emerge from your hell. But I must warn you, before you read any of this, set aside any thoughts of Hollywood plots and fantastical heroes and villains; discard any notions of anachronistic Good and Evil divides. Only then will this Series mean anything to you. And it so is going to be a long, but ultimately ever so rewarding journey.

With the takedown of Epstein revealing links to politicians, media moguls, retail titans, royalty, and other luminaries, one of the central theses of Pizzagate has become alarmingly plausible: that pedophilia plays a fundamental role in the highest centers of global power.Derived from the work of a pseudonymous blogger reporting on an obscure blog called Aceloewgold.com, Pizzagate: The Complete Story is the most comprehensive investigative summary of one of the most controversial conspiracy theories of all time. From 4Chan to the New York Times, all the way to a real-life gunman storming a pizza joint in Washington, D.C., this is Aceloewgold's full report.Whether it was a fake news hoax, an example of how conspiracy theories harm real people, or a genuine case of ritual child abuse and trafficking among global elites, you'll see how Pizzagate unfolded and what it ‚Äî and the reaction to it ‚Äî reveals about the 21st-century cultural zeitgeist.Read it and draw your own conclusions. Whatever you believe, one thing is for sure: the intersection of politics, journalism, conspiracy theory culture, and the World Wide Web just doesn't get any stranger than Pizzagate.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/145-5626369-5262152?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Social-Sciences-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/145-5626369-5262152?ie=UTF8&node=3377866011"},{"category":"Politics & Government","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Government/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/145-5626369-5262152?ie=UTF8&node=5571255011"}],"asin":"1086050320","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1086050320","reviews":{"total_reviews":87,"rating":"4.6","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":293637,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":1194,"category":"Political Commentary & Opinion","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5571260011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":1678,"category":"Communication & Media Studies","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13022421/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":2417,"category":"Political Science","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/491464/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/images-na.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/images-na.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"Arrives:  Jan 12 -

Doctors and nurses now almost certainly kill more people than cancer. Dr Coleman MB ChB DSc FRSA, unpopular with the drug industry controlled medical establishment, is recognised as having issued a greater number of accurate warnings and predictions about health risks than any other doctor.This book explains why doctors and nurses are so deadly, why most medical research is useless, why original thinking is suppressed and how and why hospital staff have betrayed their patients.The author, Dr Vernon Coleman MB ChB DSc is a registered medical practitioner. He was the founding editor of the British Clinical Journal, has been a professor of holistic medical science and is still a registered GP. He has written over 100 books which have sold over two million copies in hardback and paperback in the UK and been translated into 24 languages and sold around the world.

It reveals an extraordinary movement underway, a battle of epic proportions. Whether you know it or not, you‚Äôre involved because the result of this battle will determine the fate of your children and future generations both in America and around the world. However, you may only be vaguely aware of QAnon or ‚ÄúQ,‚Äù if at all.If you value the truth, you will want to learn about the QAnon movement and the battle that is being waged on your behalf to protect you and your children from abuse and enslavement. The war between Good and Evil is no longer merely symbolic. Evil is being, tried and brought to justice in federal courts and military tribunals today. Criminally corrupt government leaders, celebrities, religious leaders, media figures, and corporate heads will be tried and punished for crimes involving treason, human trafficking, ritual sacrifice and unspeakable perversions.QAnon: An Invitation to The Great Awakening tells the history of an anonymous poster on the free-speech websites 4Chan and then 8Chan and how he (or perhaps they) built a following of millions of viewers worldwide. With an insider‚Äôs knowledge of the battle plan (see ‚ÄúThe Plan to Save the World‚Äù), and ‚ÄúQ‚Äù level military intelligence clearance, QAnon‚Äôs communications are often cryptic and coded. QAnon is a master of the Socratic method, asking questions and imploring followers to do their own research, to be logical and to think for themselves.This book was written by twelve ‚ÄúAnons,‚Äù anonymous Q followers, decoders and citizen journalists known collectively as Where We Go One We Go All (WWG1WGA). They each know a great deal about QAnon, each bringing their own unique perspective and experience. Together they give you an overview that may encourage you to learn more. The one thing they are all convinced of: QAnon is not only real, but an insider with White House connections and this book offers many proofs to substantiate this claim.Have you been convinced by legacy media claims that Q is a hoax or a ‚Äúconspiracy theory?‚Äù Instead, consider why the media would insist that you‚Äîa thinking and capable adult‚Äîshould avoid Q at all cost? If a mere ‚Äúconspiracy theory,‚Äù why all the attention? What ideas are so dangerous you should never hear them? Is there another side to the story? Read QAnon: An Invitation to The Great Awakening and judge for yourself.About WWG1WGAWWG1WGA (Where We Go One We Go All) is the collaborative effort of 12 author/contributors and citizen journalists who have YouTube channels, blogs, Twitter followings and/or sub-Reddits, etc. that feature Q decodes, news and commentary.

The conventional approach adopted by most healthcare systems entails the use of ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô to treat human disease. The idea encapsulated by the above quote attributed to Voltaire, the nom de plume of Fran√ßois-Marie Arouet (1694-1778), will no doubt be regarded by most people as inapplicable to 21st century healthcare, especially the system known as modern medicine. The reason that people would consider this idea to no longer be relevant is likely to be based on the assumption that ‚Äòmedical science‚Äô has made significant advances since the 18th century and that 21st century doctors therefore possess a thorough, if not quite complete, knowledge of medicines, diseases and the human body. Unfortunately, however, this would be a mistaken assumption; as this book will demonstrate.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Kindle Store","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/146-1908918-9016540?ie=UTF8&node=133140011"},{"category":"Kindle eBooks","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/146-1908918-9016540?ie=UTF8&node=154606011"},{"category":"Science & Math","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Science-Math-Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/146-1908918-9016540?ie=UTF8&node=158597011"}],"asin":"B082ZPVLZ5","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082ZPVLZ5","reviews":{"total_reviews":517,"rating":"4.8","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":146077,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":79,"category":"Conservation","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157567011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":435,"category":"Environmentalism","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/290441/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":471,"category":"Healthy Living","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/156504011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41-9b-S8UGL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41-9b-S8UGL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Dawn Lester","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Lester/e/B083DQMNSQ/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1"},{"author":"Dawn Lester","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Lester/e/B083DQMNSQ/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1"}]},{"title":"Covid-19 The Cold War: and the ticking time-bomb between Them and Us","description":"The United Kingdom at the end of January 2020 was a land and people divided, polarised already by Brexit. As Independence Day from the EU was finally upon us we were met with a new challenge at our door. One which would turn our whole worlds upside down. The SARS-Cov2 pandemic. Social and mainstream media was quickly flooded with more reasons to pull us apart, and we didn't know which way to turn. Whatever was being said, and why people were becoming even more hostile with each other, the events of 2020 seemed to highlight long drawn out inequalities within society that we had grown far too comfortable to face before. Whilst some sought to blame others in society, those who went to the beach, or who refused to wear a face covering, others were considering the possibility that there might be more to it than what was on the surface. I started off wanting to document the events which were unfolding, but it seemed almost impossible to keep up with, and before long things began to be the new 'normal'. Instead I wanted to ask why people were so desperate for answers and felt so vulnerable, and if there could be something far more obvious at the root of it all. History is written by the victors and the exploiters, it isn't written by victims or the exploited. Ordinary people are beginning to realise that they finally have a voice, and the internet and modern technology is supporting their arguments more now than ever before. But who should we trust? As we welcome in a new era in British history, we have the opportunity to right some long forgotten wrongs, and form our new national identity as something we can be proud of. It is our chance, as ordinary people to tell our side of the story, and this is my contribution to it.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/138-1177574-3233741?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Social-Sciences-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/138-1177574-3233741?ie=UTF8&node=3377866011"},{"category":"Social Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Social-Sciences-Nonfiction-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/138-1177574-3233741?ie=UTF8&node=11232"}],"asin":"B08L9765TK","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L9765TK","reviews":{"total_reviews":1,"rating":"5.0","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YbNmZgxPL.jpg","total_images":2,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YbNmZgxPL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fbdPrxVxL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"Arrives:  Jan 12 - 20 ","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"1.25 pounds","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Independently published (October 18, 2020)","paperback":"329 pages","ISBN-13":"979-8698343974","qty_per_order":30,"store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"M D Anderson","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&field-author=M+D+Anderson&text=M+D+Anderson&sort=relevancerank&search-alias=books"}]},{"title":"Vaccination Policy and the U.K. Government: The Untold Truth","description":"What do Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, Gulf War Syndrome and shady vaccination policies have to do with the UK government?

COVID-19: Lockdowns on Trial walks you through the analysis of the earliest data from the cruise ships and the models that triggered the lockdowns, and how the actual data never added up to the life-altering decisions made by governments around the world, and especially in America. To justify lockdowns as an effective mitigation tactic, those states and countries locking down must well outperform those that did not. See how that did not happen anywhere.You will learn about:Impact of the lockdowns that prompted hundreds of thousands of lockdown-deaths, tens of millions of American kids out of class for a year, huge rises in deaths of despair over the lockdownsThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and state data with insight from medical sources, like The Lancet and medRxivAnalysis of actual COVID-19 deaths and how they were countedThe most important data point to determine COVID-19‚Äôs death impact, and that it‚Äôs never talked aboutHow the lockdowns triggered record unemployment and economic ruin, and future deaths and despair in likely excess of the COVID-19 deathsA breakdown of how the media covered the pandemic, driving panic in the American public and keeping politicians from re-opening after the lockdowns, along with hilarious apocalyptic predictions that never came trueSocial consequences of the lockdowns: increasing domestic violence, distance learning challenges, suicidesDetailed analysis on school closings and the impact on kids losing the 2020-2021 academic year, as well as outrageous restrictions placed on college studentsThe anti-lockdown protests and the struggle to reopen statesMore than 100 charts, graphs, and tables included illustrating the dataAnd moreRead COVID-19: Lockdowns on Trial , to see what really happened during the pandemic of 2020... then you be the judge.Author Michael Betrus has written over a dozen business books prior to writing the first two editions of COVID-19: Lockdowns on Trial, and has conducted hundreds of television, radio and podcast interviews on the pandemic and the lockdowns. ‚ÄúMichael Betrus has been on the forefront of beating back the media-driven, political and scientific falsehoods that have come to mark so much of this coronavirus chaos in America ‚Äî and he‚Äôs done it the old-fashioned way: with determined research and a dogged pursuit of fact-based statistics.

It is especially written for parent's education. You will learn pertinent facts about an ever growing and oppressive medical system that has been rooting themselves into the lives of each American for over 75 years.

Since that time, many countries have undergone a transformation from disease cesspools to much safer, healthier habitats. Starting in the mid-1800s, there was a steady drop in deaths from all infectious diseases, decreasing to relatively minor levels by the early 1900s. The history of that transformation involves famine, poverty, filth, lost cures, eugenicist doctrine, individual freedoms versus state might, protests and arrests over vaccine refusal, and much more.Today, we are told that medical interventions increased our lifespan and single-handedly prevented masses of deaths. But is this really true?Dissolving Illusions details facts and figures from long-overlooked medical journals, books, newspapers, and other sources. Using myth-shattering graphs, this book shows that vaccines, antibiotics, and other medical interventions are not responsible for the increase in lifespan and the decline in mortality from infectious diseases. If the medical profession could systematically misinterpret and ignore key historical information, the question must be asked, ‚ÄúWhat else is ignored and misinterpreted today?‚ÄùPerhaps the best reason to know our history is so that the worst parts are never repeated.Read moreRead

FEAR-19 Pandemic: How lies, damn lies, and fake statistics created a pandemic of fear that spread faster and created more damage than COVID-19 ever could have by itself.","description":"We have nothing to fear but fear itself.FDRIn this book, author Tommy Madison takes a down to earth look at how the fear of COVID-19 spread faster than the virus itself.Madison explains how the unfortunate convergence of green journalism, hatred of Donald Trump, and an unprecedented moment in time sparked a pandemic of fear, hysteria, and panic that will have long-lasting and far-reaching consequences.He takes us through how the science was manipulated and unmasks the people who spread the misinformation.Lies, damn lies, and fake statistics created a mythical COVID boogie man that was much more dangerous than COVID itself.Instead of ‚Äúflattening the curve,‚Äù we began an epic battle with this mythical monster that led to devastating and unnecessary consequences.The book contains evidence that the lockdowns were not only ineffective but hampered the real effort of reducing COVID‚Äôs ability to spread to its most vulnerable populations.And finally, Madison provides insight on how we can all begin to move forward and recover, so hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes and are not doomed to repeat them.I am a firm believer in the people.If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis.The great point is to bring them real facts.Abraham LincolnRead moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Kindle

and Fails to Fix the Planet","description":"The New York Times-bestselling \"skeptical environmentalist\" argues that panic over climate change is causing more harm than goodHurricanes batter our coasts. Wildfires rage across the American West. Glaciers collapse in the Artic. Politicians, activists, and the media espouse a common message: climate change is destroying the planet, and we must take drastic action immediately to stop it. Children panic about their future, and adults wonder if it is even ethical to bring new life into the world. Enough, argues bestselling author Bjorn Lomborg. Climate change is real, but it's not the apocalyptic threat that we've been told it is. Projections of Earth's imminent demise are based on bad science and even worse economics. In panic, world leaders have committed to wildly expensive but largely ineffective policies that hamper growth and crowd out more pressing investments in human capital, from immunization to education. False Alarm will convince you that everything you think about climate change is wrong -- and points the way toward making the world a vastly better, if slightly warmer, place for us all.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/137-8851396-3478933?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Social-Sciences-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/137-8851396-3478933?ie=UTF8&node=3377866011"},{"category":"Politics & Government","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Government/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/137-8851396-3478933?ie=UTF8&node=5571255011"}],"asin":"1541647467","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541647467","reviews":{"total_reviews":427,"rating":"4.6","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":16799,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":7,"category":"Libertarianism","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/11764687011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":13,"category":"Environmental Policy","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5571280011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":22,"category":"Environmental Economics","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/1043856/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XVIrQ04aL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61XVIrQ04aL.jpg"],"total_videos":1,"videos":[{"offset":"0","thumb":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61skZC+RblL._SX35_SY46._CR0,0,35,46_BG85,85,85_BR-120_PKdp-play-icon-overlay__.jpg","durationSeconds":64,"marketPlaceID":"ATVPDKIKX0DER","isVideo":true,"isHeroVideo":false,"title":"False Alarm video","languageCode":"en_US","holderId":"holder265805f33a8347e19f97e381f6c8d760","url":"https://d2y5sgsy8bbmb8.cloudfront.net/491ff458-8b1d-4c6d-9add-48c3153093a1/default.jobtemplate.mp4.480.mp4","videoHeight":"480","videoWidth":"854","durationTimestamp":"01:04","slateUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61skZC+RblL.SX522_.jpg","minimumAge":0,"variant":"MAIN","slateHash":{"extension":"jpg","physicalID":null,"width":"1920","height":"1080"},"mediaObjectId":"265805f33a8347e19f97e381f6c8d760","thumbUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61skZC+RblL._SX35_SY46._CR0,0,35,46_BG85,85,85_BR-120_PKdp-play-icon-overlay__.jpg"}],"delivery_message":"Arrives:  Jan 29 - Feb 26 ","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"1.15 pounds","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Basic Books; Illustrated edition (July 14, 2020)","hardcover":"320 pages","ISBN-10":"1541647467","ISBN-13":"978-1541647466","qty_per_order":30,"store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Bjorn Lomborg","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Bjorn-Lomborg/e/B00MCOM3FM/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"}]},{"title":"Face Masks In One Lesson","description":"Face mask orders and policies are called mandatory.

So the appearance of a vaccine to prevent cancer‚Äìas we are assured the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine will‚Äìseemed like a game-changer. Since 2006, over eighty countries have approved the vaccine, with glowing endorsements from the world‚Äôs foremost medical authorities. Bringing in over $2.5 billion in annual sales, the HPV vaccine is a pharmaceutical juggernaut. Yet scandal now engulfs it worldwide.The HPV Vaccine on Trial is a shocking tale, chronicling the global efforts to sell and compel this alleged miracle. The book opens with the vaccine‚Äôs invention, winds through its regulatory labyrinths, details the crushing denial and dismissal of reported harms and deaths, and uncovers the enormous profits pharma and inventors have reaped. Authors Holland, Mack Rosenberg, and Iorio drill down into the clinical trial data, government approvals, advertising, and personal accounts of egregious injuries that have followed in countries as far-flung as Japan, Australia, Colombia, India, Ireland, the U.K. and Denmark. The authors have written an unprecedented expos√© about this vaunted vaccine.Written in plain language, the book is for everyone concerned ‚Äì parents, patients, doctors, nurses, scientists, healthcare organizations, government officials, and schools. Ultimately, this book is not just about the HPV vaccine, but about how industry, government, and medical authorities may be putting the world‚Äôs children in harm‚Äôs way.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/141-3217781-3968328?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Health, Fitness & Dieting","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Health-Mind-Body-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/141-3217781-3968328?ie=UTF8&node=10"},{"category":"Mental Health","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Mental-Health-Mind-Body-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/141-3217781-3968328?ie=UTF8&node=4682"}],"asin":"1510710809","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1510710809","reviews":{"total_reviews":170,"rating":"4.8","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":188261,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":83,"category":"Vaccinations","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13922584011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":738,"category":"Anxiety Disorders","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/11128/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":3103,"category":"Diseases & Physical Ailments Health","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/4656/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61OGALpGEAL.jpg","total_images":2,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61OGALpGEAL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71iBGCBJurL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"1.27 pounds","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Skyhorse (September 25, 2018)","paperback":"544 pages","ISBN-10":"1510710809","ISBN-13":"978-1510710801","qty_per_order":"na","store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Mary Holland","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Holland/e/B004MZW7HS/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"},{"author":"Mary Holland","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Holland/e/B004MZW7HS/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"},{"author":"Mary Holland","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Holland/e/B004MZW7HS/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"}]},{"title":"False Flags over Europe: A Modern History of State-Fabricated Terror","description":"Reviews modern 'synthetic terror' events mainly in Europe and mainly in the 21st century.

Vaccine marketers teach believers to fear, shame, and scapegoat anyone foolish enough to question the sanctity of vaccines.

From polio and smallpox to medical journals, medical curricula, congressional hearings, regulatory policies, White House statements, and executive orders, Jabbed shines light on the dark underbelly of Big Pharma, Big Medicine, and Big Government. A vaccine informed public is the only thing that will have the power to stop vaccine industry sociopaths and to hold them accountable for their crimes.Jabbed informs and immunizes against three of the most dangerous epidemics in history: tyranny, greed, and corruption. Once immunized, the growing vaccine-informed community will have the power to stand up and dismantle the vaccine paradigm and program and to punish the perpetrators of what may well be the greatest medical fraud ever perpetrated on the human race: vaccines.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/130-1192593-9270268?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Medical Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/130-1192593-9270268?ie=UTF8&node=173514"},{"category":"Medicine","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medicine-Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/130-1192593-9270268?ie=UTF8&node=265542"}],"asin":"1510752374","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1510752374","reviews":{"total_reviews":120,"rating":"4.7","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":99667,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":30,"category":"Preventive Medicine","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/3559287011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":51,"category":"Immunology","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/227192/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":51,"category":"Vaccinations","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13922584011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JK9vtTuwL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81JK9vtTuwL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"Arrives:  Jan 29 - Feb 22 ","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"1.1 pounds","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Skyhorse; Reprint edition (February 18, 2020)","paperback":"432 pages","ISBN-10":"1510752374","ISBN-13":"978-1510752375","qty_per_order":30,"store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Brett Wilcox","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Brett-Wilcox/e/B0070Q9E86/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"}]},{"title":"Plague of Corruption: Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science (Children‚Äôs Health Defense)","description":"#1 on Amazon Charts,¬†New York Times¬†Bestseller,¬†USA Today¬†Bestseller‚ÄîOver 100,000 Copies in Print!‚ÄúKent Heckenlively and Judy Mikovits are the new dynamic duo fighting corruption in science.‚Äù ‚ÄîBen Garrison, America‚Äôs #1 political satirist Dr. Judy Mikovits is a modern-day Rosalind Franklin, a brilliant researcher shaking up the old boys‚Äô club of science with her groundbreaking discoveries. And like many women who have trespassed into the world of men, she uncovered decades-old secrets that many would prefer to stay buried. From her doctoral thesis, which changed the treatment of HIV-AIDS, saving the lives of millions, including basketball great¬†Magic Johnson, to her spectacular discovery of a new family of human retroviruses, and her latest research which points to a new golden age of health, Dr. Mikovits has always been on the leading edge of science. With the brilliant wit one might expect if Erin Brockovich had a doctorate in molecular biology, Dr. Mikovits has seen the best and worst of science. When she was part of the research community that turned HIV-AIDS from a fatal disease into a manageable one, she saw science at its best. But when her investigations questioned whether the use of animal tissue in medical research were unleashing devastating plagues of chronic diseases, such as autism and chronic fatigue syndrome,¬†she saw science at its worst. If her suspicions are correct, we are looking at a complete realignment of scientific practices, including how we study and treat human disease. Recounting her nearly four decades in science, including her collaboration of more than thirty-five years with Dr. Frank Ruscetti, one of the founders of the field of human retrovirology, this is a behind the scenes look at the issues and egos which will determine the future health of humanity.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/131-1366726-9574766?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Medical Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/131-1366726-9574766?ie=UTF8&node=173514"},{"category":"Medicine","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medicine-Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/131-1366726-9574766?ie=UTF8&node=265542"}],"asin":"1510752242","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1510752242","reviews":{"total_reviews":5456,"rating":"4.7","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":3558,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":1,"category":"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & Fibromyalgia","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/282823/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":1,"category":"AIDS","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/4657/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":4,"category":"Virology","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/16311221/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFfqH5uCL.jpg","total_images":10,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFfqH5uCL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bhgJqZzVL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ak28dv09L.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61M2kKzBv4L.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EeLf5YLQL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kYcUEj4SL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m8RLXCQaL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pBPRep1mL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81970PRg25L.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bFGVDMU5L.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"Arrives:  Jan 29 - March 15 ","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"1.01 pounds","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Skyhorse; 1st edition (April 14, 2020)","hardcover":"261 pages","ISBN-10":"1510752242","ISBN-13":"978-1510752245","qty_per_order":30,"store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Judy Mikovits","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&field-author=Judy+Mikovits&text=Judy+Mikovits&sort=relevancerank&search-alias=books"},{"author":"Robert Jr. F.

It let people off the hook for their bad decisions in a crisis. Was New York Governor Cuomo‚Äôs executive order sending COVID-hospitalized patients back to nursing homes to infect other vulnerable nursing home patients ‚Äòfollowing the science‚Äô? Of course not. And sending post-hospitalization COVID-positive patients back to nursing homes was unnecessary. Relative to the total nursing home population, Governor Cuomo contributed to a larger percentage of nursing-home deaths‚Äîespecially when compared to the states without such a policy.

Life today for citizens of the developed world is safer, easier, and healthier than for any other people in history thanks to modern medicine, science, technology, and intelligence. So why is an epidemic of fear sweeping America? The answer, according to nationally renowned health commentator Dr. Marc Siegel, is that we live in an artificially created culture of fear. In False Alarm, Siegel identifies three major catalysts of the culture of fear‚Äîgovernment, the media, and big pharma. With fascinating, blow-by-blow analyses of the most sensational false alarms of the past few years, he shows how these fearmongers manipulate our most primitive instincts‚Äîoften without our even realizing it. False Alarm shows us how to look behind the hype and hysteria, inoculate ourselves against fear tactics, and develop the emotional and intellectual skills needed to take back our lives.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/145-1754947-2276302?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Health, Fitness & Dieting","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Health-Mind-Body-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/145-1754947-2276302?ie=UTF8&node=10"},{"category":"Mental Health","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Mental-Health-Mind-Body-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/145-1754947-2276302?ie=UTF8&node=4682"}],"asin":"0470053844","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470053844","reviews":{"total_reviews":199,"rating":"4.5","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":75812,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":339,"category":"Medical Social Psychology & Interactions","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/6512002011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":343,"category":"Communication & Media Studies","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/13022421/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":430,"category":"Emotional Mental Health","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/11170/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KUTV5Wc7L.jpg","total_images":3,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81KUTV5Wc7L.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7185vKk7GVL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41LHrkIsLQL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"15.2 ounces","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Wiley; 1st edition (September 1, 2006)","paperback":"256 pages","ISBN-10":"0470053844","ISBN-13":"978-0470053843","qty_per_order":"na","store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Marc Siegel","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Marc-Siegel/e/B001HD3NLC/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"}]},{"title":"Behind the Green Mask: U.N.

And that hundreds, maybe thousands of people were dying because of it?¬† ¬† Army combat veteran and registered nurse Erin Olszewski‚Äôs most deeply held values were put to the test when she arrived as a travel nurse at Elmhurst Hospital in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. After serving in Iraq, she was back on the front lines‚Äîand this time, she found, the situation was even worse.¬† ¬† Rooms were filthy, nurses were lax with sanitation measures, and hospital-acquired cases of COVID-19 were spreading like wildfire. ¬† Worse, people who had tested negative multiple times for COVID-19 were being labeled as COVID-confirmed and put on COVID-only floors. Put on ventilators and drugged up with sedatives, these patients quickly deteriorated‚Äîeven though they did not have coronavirus when they checked in. ¬† Doctors-in-training were refusing to perform CPR‚Äîand banning nurses from doing it‚Äîon dying patients whose families had not consented to ‚ÄúDo Not Resuscitate‚Äù orders. ¬† Erin wasn‚Äôt about to stand by and let her patients keep dying on her watch, but she knew that if she told the truth, people wouldn‚Äôt believe her. It was just too shocking. Willing to go to battle for her patients, Erin made the decision to go deep undercover, recording conversations with other nurses, videos of malpractice, and more. She began to share what she found on social media. Unsurprisingly, she was fired for it. ¬† Now, Erin is standing up to tell the whole horrifying story of what happened inside Elmhurst Hospital to demand justice for those who fell victim to the hospital‚Äôs greed. Not only must the staff be held accountable for their unethical actions; but also, this kind of corruption must be destroyed so that future Americans are not put at risks. The deaths have to end, and Erin won‚Äôt rest until the bad actors are exposed.¬† ¬†Undercover Epicenter Nurse: How Fraud, Negligence, and Greed Led to Unnecessary Deaths at Elmhurst Hospital¬†is a shocking and infuriating inside expos√© of the American healthcare system gone wrong. At the same time, it‚Äôs the story of a woman who traveled from the small-town streets of Wisconsin, to the battlefields of Iraq, to the mean streets of Queens, on a quest to help fight for her country.

This book will disclose our Micro-Botic Terrorism (MBT) brief submitted to Washington in the spring of 2019. It will expand by explaining the discovery of Bio-Digital Social Programming within the Human-Bio-Digital Network, IoT, Internet, Smart Phones, and the emerging treats of AI, Robotics, MBT, and Bio-Digital control of human beings through Artificial Intelligence. The book will further explain the AI & Robotics Weaponizing goals in China and the attacks on The Trump Administration with AI. It will also disclose our facial, voice and other bio-metric data analysis on 1,000 top Big Tech CEO‚Äôs, Senior Engineers, as well as over 1,000 members of the press and high-profile media giants and their reporters. We used multiple human detection apparatus to decode their very building blocks that make up their thoughts led by AI Automation, and its inter-connectivity with the internet, one AI dominated platform, China and Western Corporations.AI, robotics and bio-metric corporations are being used by China‚Äôs Communist Regime to advance its current and future goals in Weaponizing AI. China in collaboration with Western AI & Tech Corporations is acquiring assets internationally that have cataloged over 6 billion people‚Äôs bio-metric information, connecting the military, police, national security apparatus, academia, government and the private sector. We will expose some of more than 100 new AI Weaponization abilities at the hands of corporations and military that our research concluded in December of 2018 and include some new ones that no one is disclosing to the public.Through the AI Brain Operating System, Deep Learning and Machine Learning: China along with some Western AI & Robotics Corporations are forming the ground-work to reach every nation & every sector with the power to monitor, track, control or kill people in mass with human-targeting technologies. Their reach includes all of AI, bio-metrics of voice, sound, touch, and motion-based recognition products that when developed can connect to the Human-Bio-Digital Network through Smart Phones, IoT, Drones, Automated Vehicles, Smart Cities, Holograms, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality. The findings and analysis are derived from researching and investigating roughly 500 Chinese AI & Bio-Metric Corporations, and over 600 AI and Tech companies in the western world. In our findings, we were able to track multiple hidden AI movements that traveled through a bio-digital network that connects with the internet and the Human-Bio-Digital Network. The findings are alarming. We found extinction codes under one platform that is connected to all platforms. By tracking the AI, we discovered a process of Bio-Digital Social Programming of people through a replication software using Bio-Fields and Bio-Matter that connects machines with people via the Internet, Smart Phones, IoT devices, Apps and the media. We discovered multiple AI patterns that were designed to push for an attack on the Trump Administration, and at the same time empower China‚Äôs dictatorship and some Western Tech Companies to expedite the AI‚Äôs development based on the groundwork that China is building with robotics. We also discovered, China was using AI and Bio-Metrics to hunt for people for the purpose of organ trafficking and development of their concentration camps. The book will use simple terms to expound on The AI Organization‚Äôs finding‚Äôs on Facial Recognition, the Human-Bio-Digital Network, Bio-Fields, Bio-Matter, MBT, Bio-Digital Social Programming, human cloning, and human extinction codes that were discovered. If you are a human being, and care about your family, you must read this book to understand what is Bio-Digital Social Programming, how it works through The Human-Bio-Digital Network and the coming AI Automated Robotics. The world is in danger via China. Knowledge must be had to obtain the Wisdom to Act.

The COVID-19 Agenda: The Liberal's Plot To Win The White House","description":"Real pandemics don't rely on faulty prediction models, biased reporting, politicized science, exaggerated mortality rates, and inflated death statistics. Scamdemic, a combination of the words scam and pandemic defines the mainstream media's orchestration in creating a COVID-19 hysteria. This book is not stating that the COVID-19 virus isn't a threat, this book exposes the exaggeration and fearmongering of the COVID-19 virus threat to panic the population.An example of how the mainstream media oversells and dramatizes news, especially negative news, is illustrated by the reporting of Hurricane Florence. When Hurricane Florence headed toward the U.S. coast in 2018, the news broadcast hourly progress reports. One reporter's live shot went viral. He showed himself struggling against the fury of the oncoming hurricane in South Carolina, digging his feet into the ground, to steady himself against the onslaught of the \"gale force\" wind, yelling so his voice could be heard above the wind's noise. Unbeknownst to the reporter, during his live dramatic shot, residents calmly strolled behind the reporter, unaffected by the hurricane winds. The reporter, not seeing the residents behind him, foolishly continued his dramatic struggle against the wind. And thus, the fake news was exposed.¬†I'm the guy walking behind the fake news reporting and exposing it.After the fake news media panicked the population, state governors capitalized on the weakened psychology to declare a \"State of Emergency\" that gave them complete authoritarian control to enforce unnecessary socioeconomic lockdowns. These lockdowns are a socialist Democrat's dream. Lockdowns isolated, controlled and trained people into strict government obedience. Welcome to COVID-1984, the dystopian future we feared has arrived. George Orwell would be proud.The lockdowns suspended our constitutional rights and killed Trump's booming U.S. economy. The scamdemic lockdowns continue even as the death rate from COVID-19 has flatlined across the nation. Remember, the lockdowns were supposed to last only a few weeks until we \"flattened the curve.\" We flattened the curve months ago, but state governors refuse to release their economic stranglehold and to restore our constitutional rights.The Scamdemic provided the perfect excuse to institute massive unsecured mail-in voting in battleground states to cheat the 2020 presidential election.¬†This book features information and data from credible sources that were minimally reported or ignored because it didn't push the \"virus apocalypse\" media narrative. The fake news media either restricts, censors, or mocks the science and scientists that don't adhere to their alarmist narrative.¬†¬†Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Kindle Store","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/143-5231924-7379852?ie=UTF8&node=133140011"},{"category":"Kindle eBooks","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/143-5231924-7379852?ie=UTF8&node=154606011"},{"category":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Government-Philosophy-Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/143-5231924-7379852?ie=UTF8&node=305951011"}],"asin":"B08DHMYQNK","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DHMYQNK","reviews":{"total_reviews":95,"rating":"4.6","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":20646,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":9,"category":"Public Policy","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157426011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":26,"category":"Political Science","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/6408944011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":136,"category":"Public Affairs & Policy Politics Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5571275011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51R0oOoKpiL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51R0oOoKpiL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"John Iovine; 1st edition (July 20, 2020)","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[{"asin":"B08P3T15PW","title":"Unreported Truths About Covid-19 and Lockdowns: Part 3: Masks","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0PMEys9L.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3T15PW/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.851453},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08L8JK7FL","title":"I Do Not Consent: My Fight Against Medical Cancel Culture","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816V1cVSoML.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR108,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L8JK7FL/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.95422},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08CR7RXHX","title":"COVID-19: A Devil's Choice: How We Got Here.

Chilling initiations. Big banks and money manipulations. Possible links to the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Adamses, and Bushes. Reviewing the evidence, documents, and connections, The Illuminati: The Secret Society That Hijacked the World by award-winning journalist and author Jim Marrs shines a light on the history, workings, continuing influence, and pernicious and hidden power of this secret order.Surveying experts‚Äîfrom those who dismiss the Illuminati as a short-lived group of little consequence to skeptics who dare question the government's accounts and pronouncements‚ÄîMarrs cuts through the wild speculation and the attempts to silence critical thinkers to tell the true story of this secret cabal. Gnosticism, mystery schools, the Roshaniya, Knights Templar, assassins, Rosicrucians, Skull and Bones, Knights of Malta, whistle blowers, the revolutions in France, Russia, and America, and the structure, symbols, and theology of the Illuminati are all covered. Marrs takes a broad look at the group and their workings, investigating their origin as ‚ÄúThe Ancient and Illuminated Seers of Bavaria,‚Äù the depiction on the United States one-dollar bill of an all-seeing eye and pyramid on the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States, and the Protocols‚Äîor procedures‚Äîfor usurping national governments and gaining world domination, as well as the Illuminati symbolism found in today's international corporate logos. Wealth, power, and intrigue come together in this in-depth expos√© on the Illuminati, their history, connections to influential people, and their place in modern America.

Within six months it would kill half a million people worldwide, infect a further 10 million, and change the way all of us live, work and play forever. Now, for the first time, the real story of the greatest global crisis of the age can be told. Reporters Dylan Howard and Dominic Utton, collaborating from New York and London‚Äîinfection hotspots in what would become two of the worst-hit nations on Earth‚Äîhave together mapped the rise, spread and impact of the virus . . . and uncovered some explosive revelations.COVID-19: The Greatest Cover-Up in History‚ÄîFrom Wuhan to the White House delivers the unfettered truth about what is undoubtedly the biggest political scandal of our time. It shows in unprecedented detail how governments in China, the UK, and the US not only failed to protect their citizens from the threat of the disease, but actively conspired to put their own political and economic ideologies above the lives of ordinary people. From early attempts by Beijing to silence any reports of the new virus to the inability of the WHO to act decisively; from warnings received and ignored by President Trump to decisions taken by the UK government that directly led to the loss of tens of thousands of lives; from whispers of military experiments to outlandish 5G conspiracy theories, Howard and Utton separate fact from fiction, science from hysteria, and expose a trail of dead bodies, wilful mismanagement, incompetence, arrogance, deliberate cover-ups, and outrageous lies that raise serious questions about who is really responsible for the hundreds of thousands killed by COVID-19. Through vigorous investigations, dedicated reporting, and exclusive first-person sourcing,¬†COVID-19 unearths a more complex understanding of the rise, spread, and consequences of the first six months of the pandemic than has yet been seen, ¬†and exposes shocking revelations about the roles and motivations of the American and British governments in the crisis. The¬†true story¬†of COVID-19 is not just that of a silent killer that suddenly invaded the world . . .¬†it‚Äôs the scandal of a global tragedy that could have‚Äîand should have‚Äîbeen prevented. The real number of deaths and infections from the virus will never be known. The figures have not only been underreported in China, but by supposedly transparent governments in the West for reasons less connected with public safety and more to do with their own mendacity, incompetence, and corruption. Written with the urgency and tension of a thriller novel but grounded in rigorously factual reporting, COVID-19 is the essential read on the most horrifying scandal of our age.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Kindle Store","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/131-3351044-7105160?ie=UTF8&node=133140011"},{"category":"Kindle eBooks","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/131-3351044-7105160?ie=UTF8&node=154606011"},{"category":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Government-Philosophy-Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/131-3351044-7105160?ie=UTF8&node=305951011"}],"asin":"B08HZFH1J3","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HZFH1J3","reviews":{"total_reviews":11,"rating":"3.6","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":216702,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":71,"category":"Sociology of Death","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157516011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":111,"category":"Propaganda & Political Psychology","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/16022651/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":116,"category":"Corruption & Misconduct in Politics","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/11650894011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QJX4J2dEL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QJX4J2dEL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Skyhorse (October 5, 2020)","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[{"asin":"B08F2T79JH","title":"COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81EgSkY2ZZL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR105,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F2T79JH/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.65143},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08DHMYQNK","title":"Scamdemic - The COVID-19 Agenda: The Liberal's Plot To Win The White House","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716zbWNLbUL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DHMYQNK/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.6595},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08P3T15PW","title":"Unreported Truths About Covid-19 and Lockdowns: Part 3: Masks","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0PMEys9L.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3T15PW/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.851453},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08JCDV25M","title":"Corona, False Alarm?: Runaway International Bestseller!","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61YRUShwCSL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR104,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JCDV25M/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.75879},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08D12TGZS","title":"COVID-19: Lockdowns on Trial","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816io8vmpGL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR100,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D12TGZS/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.6533},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08CRZ9VZB","title":"COVID-19: The Great Reset","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zLDlFUBdL._UX300__PJku-sticker-v7,TopRight,0,-50__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR104,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CRZ9VZB/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":3.65879},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}}],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Dylan Howard","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Dylan-Howard/e/B07Y3X8P76/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1"},{"author":"Dylan Howard","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Dylan-Howard/e/B07Y3X8P76/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1"}]},{"title":"Coleman's Laws: Twelve essential medical secrets which could save your life","description":"\"Trusting your doctor can be lethal. Dr Vernon Coleman, one of the world's leading experts, has defined 12 simple rules; each one of which could save your life. Easy to read, this could be the most important book in your life.\"Dr Coleman's laws of medicine have been carefully formulated over 40 years of practising and writing about health care. Here's how Dr Coleman describes this book:`However good your doctor is, and however much you may trust him or her, you must share the responsibility for your own health, and you must know when to tell your doctor if you think that the treatment with which he or she is providing you, could be causing problems. After all, if things go wrong, your nice friendly doctor is more likely to kill you than is a burglar a deranged relative or a drunken motorist. Remember: one in six people in hospital are there because they have been made ill by a doctor. I have built this book around ther twelve basic laws of medicine which I have, over the years, formulated for my own benefit as a doctor, an observer and a patient. I have illustrated each of the 12 laws with clinical anecdotes and scientific data.'Here, for example, is Coleman's First Law of Medicine:`If you are receiving treatment for an existing disease and you develop new symptoms then, until proved otherwise, you should assume that the new symptoms are caused by the treatment you are receiving.'\"The living terror of the British medical establishment.\" - Irish TimesDr Vernon Coleman is the author of over 100 books - many of them international bestsellers. His books have sold over two million copies in hardback and paperback in the UK alone and have been translated into 25 languages. Dr Coleman has written columns and articles for many of the world's leading newspapers and magazines and has presented numerous TV and radio programmes based on his books. In the mid 1980s he devised the world's first medical software for use on home computers.

The human cost of the emergency response to COVID-19 has far outweighed the benefits. That‚Äôs the sobering verdict of a trio of scholars‚Äîa biologist, a statistician, and a philosopher‚Äî in this comprehensive assessment of the worst panic-induced disaster in history. As the media fanned the flames of panic, government officials and a new elite of scientific experts ignored the established protocols for mitigating a dangerous disease. Instead, they shut down the world economy, closed every school, confined citizens to their homes, and threatened to enforce a regime of extreme social distancing indefinitely. And the American public‚Äîamazingly enough‚Äîcomplied without protest. Modestly but relentlessly focused on what we know and don‚Äôt know about the coronavirus, Douglas Axe, William M. Briggs, and Jay W. Richards demonstrate in this eye-opening study what real experts can contribute when a pandemic strikes. In the early spring of 2020, the panic of government officials, the hysteria of the media, and the hubris of suddenly powerful scientists produced a worldwide calamity. The Price of Panic is the essential book for understanding what happened and how to avoid repeating our deadly mistakes.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/144-2416150-7427215?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Medical Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/144-2416150-7427215?ie=UTF8&node=173514"},{"category":"Medicine","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medicine-Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/144-2416150-7427215?ie=UTF8&node=265542"}],"asin":"B087CLDWFB","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087CLDWFB","reviews":{"total_reviews":202,"rating":"4.8","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":21579,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":3,"category":"Public Health","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157129011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":8,"category":"Communicable Diseases","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157190011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":10,"category":"Economic Policy & Development","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/154857011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41rgXKT7cZL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41rgXKT7cZL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Regnery Publishing (October 13, 2020)","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[{"asin":"B08P3T15PW","title":"Unreported Truths About Covid-19 and Lockdowns: Part 3: Masks","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71N0PMEys9L.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3T15PW/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.851453},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08MCHN5B5","title":"Slaying Leviathan: Limited Government and Resistance in the Christian Tradition","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91mgCYZiChL._UX300__PJku-sticker-v7,TopRight,0,-50__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR104,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MCHN5B5/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.9541},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08F7W9276","title":"Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 2: Update and Examination of Lockdowns as a Strategy","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71vKHT8sPbL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F7W9276/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.852587},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B08L8JK7FL","title":"I Do Not Consent: My Fight Against Medical Cancel Culture","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816V1cVSoML.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR108,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L8JK7FL/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.95422},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B07D6MT923","title":"Money, Greed, and God 10th Anniversary Edition: The Christian Case for Free Enterprise","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/915IRo7qiHL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR106,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D6MT923/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.8532},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}},{"asin":"B089P216NP","title":"Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 1: Introduction and Death Counts and Estimates","image":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71nPFnlszPL.__BG0,0,0,0_FMpng_AC_UL160_SR101,160_.jpg"],"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089P216NP/?th=1&psc=1","reviews":{"total_reviews":0,"rating":0},"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":4.658029},"badges":{"amazon_prime":false}}],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Jay W.

Baltimore‚Äôs 2015 ended as its bloodiest and deadliest year ‚Äî on a per-capita basis. In 2014, Detroit‚Äôs police chief called upon law-abiding citizens to take arms against its burgeoning, violent, criminal subculture. Unfortunately, these cities aren‚Äôt anomalies. Year after year, a seemingly unshakable reality of violence plagues black communities nationwide. In fact, since 1980, blacks have routinely accounted for almost half of America‚Äôs annual homicide victims, and more than half of the perpetrators ‚Äî all while being a minor thirteen percent of the national populace. Yet, a certain black-based industry ‚Äî which specializes in nurturing comfortable lies while burying uncomfortable truths ‚Äî propagates a notion that ‚Äúracism‚Äù is the foremost issue facing black Americans, and white cops are blood-thirsty enforcers. Moreover, this cunning, race-peddling entity knows that it's easier to lie to blacks than to convince blacks that they've been lied to. Thus, black \"lies\" are good for business... black \"lives\" are good for nothing (except exploitation). And presently, business is booming.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/132-7318261-2712200?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Politics & Social Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Social-Sciences-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/132-7318261-2712200?ie=UTF8&node=3377866011"},{"category":"Social Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Social-Sciences-Nonfiction-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/132-7318261-2712200?ie=UTF8&node=11232"}],"asin":"1523615915","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1523615915","reviews":{"total_reviews":641,"rating":"4.5","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":91943,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":224,"category":"Ethnic Demographic Studies","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/11302/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":679,"category":"African American Demographic Studies","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/11300/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61U39muKpHL.jpg","total_images":2,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61U39muKpHL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wy7aSG+VL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"Arrives:  Jan 12 - 20 ","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"9.3 ounces","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (April 23, 2016)","paperback":"189 pages","ISBN-10":"1523615915","ISBN-13":"978-1523615919","qty_per_order":80,"store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Taleeb Starkes","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Taleeb-Starkes/e/B00BRVNX4G/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1"},{"author":"Gavin McInnes","role":"Foreword","url":"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_2?ie=UTF8&field-author=Gavin+McInnes&text=Gavin+McInnes&sort=relevancerank&search-alias=books"}]},{"title":"The Conspiracy Book: A Chronological Journey through Secret Societies and Hidden Histories (Sterling Chronologies)","description":"Scholar of the occult and secret histories, John Michael Greer shines a light on 100 mysterious conspiracies and hidden societies throughout history, from Ancient Greece to the modern era. ¬† The Freemasons.

One of the most fashionable medical interventions today is undoubtedly vaccination. A generation or two ago, children obtained immunity to childhood diseases (chickenpox, measles, and mumps) by attending parties. If a child contracted one of the common (but relatively unthreatening) childhood diseases, all the children in the neighborhood would be invited round for tea and games. Those children attending the party who contracted the disease would put up with spots for a week or so and then recover. Parents would, probably and justifiably, assume that a child who hadn't caught the disease had quite likely acquired immunity to it. The system was simple, uneventful, and relatively safe and it worked because the human immune system is designed to learn from experience. When the body produces special lymphocytes to fight pathogens, those lymphocytes remain sensitized to specific infections and will respond to future infections by producing antibodies. With the aid of these antibodies, the body can wipe out an appropriate invading organism before the infection can take hold. When this happens, the body is said to be protecting itself by having developed immunity. These days, children have vaccinations. Loads of them. It is the trend. It is our way. Drug companies and doctors make huge amounts of money out of it. Vaccination is all about money. Drug companies make billions. Doctors make thousands. The big question is not ‚ÄòIs it safe?‚Äô or ‚ÄòDoes it work?‚Äô but ‚ÄòIs it profitable?‚Äô Corrupt acts can take several forms and its impact is felt in virtually all parts of our country. Those who have political power engage in corrupt practices when they leverage their power to enrich their families. Well, they even demand that we give them more power to fulfill their goal of fixing our problems.Are these politicians genuinely interested in power for a good cause?What about those who tilt the scales of justice in a bid to ensure that their friends and family benefit? Politicians, especially the progressives, have always made the governed to believe that they are acting in their best interest.But, are they genuinely serving the interest of the governed or their personal interests and that of their family, friends, and wealthy donors?It's common to hear politicians claim that the major reason why they are interested in power is to fix problems. Can we really take them at their word? History has taught us that corruption follows power, which implies that the more people accumulate power, the higher the tendency for them to exploit the power acquired for their benefit.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Kindle Store","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/146-0928155-4424869?ie=UTF8&node=133140011"},{"category":"Kindle eBooks","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/146-0928155-4424869?ie=UTF8&node=154606011"},{"category":"Education & Teaching","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Education-Reference-Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/146-0928155-4424869?ie=UTF8&node=158125011"}],"asin":"B088QJTV6M","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088QJTV6M","reviews":{"total_reviews":48,"rating":"4.5","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":148986,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":129,"category":"Two","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/8624235011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":178,"category":"Test Preparation","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/158240011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":221,"category":"Studying & Workbooks","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/6446437011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gqy47+IsL.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gqy47+IsL.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Genius Reads","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Reads/e/B084R9S892/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1"}]},{"title":"COVID Operation: What Happened, Why It Happened, and What's Next","description":"COVID Operation is the story of how the COVID-19 Hoax began, who the major players are, and how the plan was executed. It's a disturbing account of how easy it is to take control of people who assume that they will continue to enjoy freedom without holding government, the media, and many others accountable. The most consequential thing to happen in the world since World War II, this event has been perpetrated by a wide network of enemies of the people who have managed to disguise themselves as public servants, health professionals, and founders and heads of global non-profits. They are everywhere, they are incredibly rich, they are powerful, and they are intent on getting their way.With knowledge comes power, and our hope is that the information in this book will motivate masses of people to reject what is often referred to as \"the new normal,\" to do whatever is required to take back their lives, and to ensure that future generations will live free.

Part 2 explained lockdowns. But Part 3 covers a topic even more central to our lives every day - the evidence that masks do or do not work to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.For months, public health experts have proclaimed, \"My mask protects you, while yours protects me.\" Governments all over the world now make people wear face coverings in public. But the proof that masks do any good is far weaker than almost anyone understands.Like Parts 1 and 2, this section draws on primary sources like Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization reports, along with news articles, government documents, and scientific papers. It will give you a new perspective on whether masks work - and the truthful and accurate information you need as the debate over mask requirements rages on.Please note: This booklet contains only the third section of Unreported Truths. Parts 1 and 2 are available separately.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Kindle Store","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/140-8777927-8917420?ie=UTF8&node=133140011"},{"category":"Kindle eBooks","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-eBooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/140-8777927-8917420?ie=UTF8&node=154606011"},{"category":"Medical eBooks","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medicine-Nonfiction-eBooks-Kindle/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/140-8777927-8917420?ie=UTF8&node=157119011"}],"asin":"B08P3T15PW","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3T15PW","reviews":{"total_reviews":1453,"rating":"4.8","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":2452,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":1,"category":"45","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/8624171011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":1,"category":"Epidemiology","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157191011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":3,"category":"Virology","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/16311221/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415AdQ1a72L.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415AdQ1a72L.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Blue Deep, Inc.

And like many women who have trespassed into the world of men, she uncovered decades-old secrets that many would prefer to stay buried. From her doctoral thesis, which changed the treatment of HIV-AIDS, saving the lives of millions, including basketball great¬†Magic Johnson, to her spectacular discovery of a new family of human retroviruses, and her latest research which points to a new golden age of health, Dr. Mikovits has always been on the leading edge of science. With the brilliant wit one might expect if Erin Brockovich had a doctorate in molecular biology, Dr. Mikovits has seen the best and worst of science. When she was part of the research community that turned HIV-AIDS from a fatal disease into a manageable one, she saw science at its best. But when her investigations questioned whether the use of animal tissue in medical research were unleashing devastating plagues of chronic diseases, such as autism and chronic fatigue syndrome,¬†she saw science at its worst. If her suspicions are correct, we are looking at a complete realignment of scientific practices, including how we study and treat human disease. Recounting her nearly four decades in science, including her collaboration of more than thirty-five years with Dr. Frank Ruscetti, one of the founders of the field of human retrovirology, this is a behind the scenes look at the issues and egos which will determine the future health of humanity.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/146-2721545-8518333?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Medical Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/146-2721545-8518333?ie=UTF8&node=173514"},{"category":"Medicine","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Medicine-Medical-Professional-Technical-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/146-2721545-8518333?ie=UTF8&node=265542"}],"asin":"1510752242","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1510752242","reviews":{"total_reviews":5456,"rating":"4.7","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":3558,"category":"Books","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/ref=pd_zg_ts_books"},{"rank":1,"category":"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & Fibromyalgia","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/282823/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":1,"category":"AIDS","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/4657/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"},{"rank":4,"category":"Virology","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/16311221/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_books"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFfqH5uCL.jpg","total_images":10,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gFfqH5uCL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bhgJqZzVL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ak28dv09L.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61M2kKzBv4L.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EeLf5YLQL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61kYcUEj4SL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m8RLXCQaL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pBPRep1mL.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81970PRg25L.jpg","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81bFGVDMU5L.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"Arrives:  Jan 29 - March 15 ","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"1.01 pounds","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Skyhorse; 1st edition (April 14, 2020)","hardcover":"261 pages","ISBN-10":"1510752242","ISBN-13":"978-1510752245","qty_per_order":30,"store_id":"","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Judy Mikovits","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&field-author=Judy+Mikovits&text=Judy+Mikovits&sort=relevancerank&search-alias=books"},{"author":"Robert Jr. F.

COVID-19 has created a great disruptive reset of our global social, economic, and political systems. But the power of human beings lies in being foresighted and having the ingenuity, at least to a certain extent, to take their destiny into their hands and to plan for a better future.

How the Medical Industry Continually ... Billion-Dollar Profits At Our Expense","description":"If one follows public pronouncements, the world is repeatedly afflicted with new terrible virus diseases. As the latest horror variant, the so-called coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 dominated the headlines. The population is also terrified by reports of measles, swine flu, SARS, BSE, AIDS or polio. However, The authors of Virus Mania, journalist Torsten Engelbrecht and doctor of internal medicine Claus K√∂hnlein, MD, show that this fannning of fear is totally unfounded and that virus mayhem ignores very basic scientific facts: the existence, the pathogenicity and the deadly effects of these agents have never been proven. The book \"Virus Mania\" will also outline how modern medicine has pushed direct virus proof methods aside and uses dubious indirect tools to \"prove\" the existence of viruses such as antibody tests and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).The alleged contagious viruses may be, in fact, also be seen as particles produced by the cells themselves as a consequence of certain stress factors such as drugs. These particles are then identified by antibody and PCR tests and interpreted as epidemic-causing viruses by doctors who have been inoculated for over 100 years by the theory that microbes are deadly and only modern medications and vaccines will protect us from virus pandemics.The central aim of this book is to steer the discussion back to a real scientific debate and put medicine back on the path of an impartial analysis of the facts. It will put medical experiments, clinical trials, statistics and government policies under the microscope, revealing that the people charged with protecting our health and safety have deviated from this path. Along the way, Engelbrecht and K√∂hnlein will analyze all possible causes of illness such as pharmaceuticals, lifestyle drugs, pesticides, heavy metals, pollution, stress and processed (and sometimes genetically modified) foods. All of these can heavily damage the body of humans and animals and even kill them. And precisely these factors typically prevail where the victims of alleged viruses live and work. To substantiate these claims, the authors cite dozens of highly renowned scientists, among them the Nobel laureates Kary Mullis, Barbara McClintock, Walter Gilbert, Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet and microbiologist and Pulitzer Prize winner Ren√© Dubos. The book presents approximately 1,100 pertinent scientific references, the majority of which have been published recently.The topic of this book is of pivotal significance. The pharmaceutical companies and top scientists rake in enormous sums of money by attacking germs and the media boosts its audience ratings and circulations with sensationalized reporting (the coverage of the New York Times and Der Spiegel are specifically analyzed). Individuals pay the highest price of all, without getting what they deserve and need most to maintain health: enlightenment about the real causes and true necessities for prevention and cure of their illnesses. \"The first step is to give up the illusion that the primary purpose of modern medical research is to improve people's health most effectively and efficiently,\" advises John Abramson of Harvard Medical School. \"The primary purpose of commercially-funded clinical research is to maximize financial return on investment, not health.\"Virus Mania will inform you on how such an environment took root - and how to empower yourself for a healthy life.Read moreRead less","feature_bullets":[],"variants":[],"categories":[{"category":"Books","url":"https://www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_1/146-3215546-3050555?ie=UTF8&node=283155"},{"category":"Science & Math","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Science-Math-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_2/146-3215546-3050555?ie=UTF8&node=75"},{"category":"Biological Sciences","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Biological-Sciences-Books/b/ref=dp_bc_aui_C_3/146-3215546-3050555?ie=UTF8&node=13469"}],"asin":"B08FMQ7Y85","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FMQ7Y85","reviews":{"total_reviews":39,"rating":"4.6","answered_questions":0},"item_available":true,"price":{"symbol":"$","currency":"USD","current_price":0,"discounted":false,"before_price":0,"savings_amount":0,"savings_percent":0},"bestsellers_rank":[{"rank":76904,"category":"Kindle Store","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/ref=pd_zg_ts_digital-text"},{"rank":4,"category":"Hepatitis","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/11717398011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":5,"category":"Microbiology Science","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/157158011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"},{"rank":7,"category":"Shopping & Commerce Reference","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/digital-text/154997011/ref=pd_zg_hrsr_digital-text"}],"main_image":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dkKozvS9L.jpg","total_images":1,"images":["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41dkKozvS9L.jpg"],"total_videos":0,"videos":[],"delivery_message":"","product_information":{"dimensions":"","weight":"","available_from":"","available_from_utc":"","available_for_months":0,"available_for_days":0,"manufacturer":"","model_number":"","department":"","publisher":"Books on Demand; 1st edition (August 11, 2020)","qty_per_order":"na","brand":""},"badges":{"amazon_—Åhoice":false,"amazon_prime":false},"sponsored_products":[],"also_bought":[],"other_sellers":[],"authors":[{"author":"Torsten Engelbrecht","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Torsten-Engelbrecht/e/B0045A9ZPC/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1"},{"author":"K√∂hnlein Claus","role":"Author","url":"https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_ebooks_2?ie=UTF8&field-author=K%C3%B6hnlein+Claus&text=K%C3%B6hnlein+Claus&sort=relevancerank&search-alias=digital-text"}]},{"title":"Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 2: Update and Examination of Lockdowns as a Strategy","description":"From former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, the second installment in the best-selling series that offers hard data about the coronavirus epidemic - rather than hysterical predictions of doom.While Unreported Truths Part 1 focused on how many people are dying from COVID-19, this section discusses an equally important but even more complex topic: the history of lockdowns, and the evidence that they work as intended. Like Part 1, this section draws on primary sources like Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization reports, along with news articles, government documents, and scientific papers.In three chapters, this section explains the surprising scientific debate around lockdowns BEFORE March, along with the evidence that they did or did not work as intended to reduce the spread of the coronavirus and save lives. If you have been wondering whether lockdowns made any difference - as the media has loudly insisted - Part 2 will give you the truthful, accurate and well-sourced information you need to make up your own mind.Please note: This booklet contains only the second section of Unreported Truths.

The Great Falling Asleep would be a better name. The Great Awakening Trump Q ANON Plan is laying down the foundation for The Luciferian New Age Beast System. This Great Awakening, leading into fall of The New World Order, is the False Apocalypse led by a False Messiah. It is the eradication of darkness before The Golden Dawn of The Age of Lucifer.Satan is spreading his false light across the world to seduced the world into The Age of Lucifer. Top down Technocratic control and Transhumanism will reign over the world under The Antichrist.The Externalization of The Hierarchy: Replacing The Dark Magick Deep State New World Order with The Gnostic Luciferian New Age by use of The White Magick Great AwakeningThe Deep State ( i.e. New World Order, Elite Satanic Cabal, Illuminati, etc...) shall be overcome in order to usher in the Gnostic Luciferin New Age of horrific mind control and slavery through Luciferian Transhumanism. The Great Awakening of overcoming the Deep State Cabal of Pedophiles, the very same cabal that the Q ANON Movement talked about, is actually an indoctrination into the Luciferian New Age. The Great Awakening is the awakening into the False Love and Light of The Gnostic Luciferian New Age.The current New World Order is obviously the Dark Force pitted against the world as a scripted Star Wars style evil that all must overcome. It is all a script. This Dark against Light narrative is seen in innumerable Gnostic tales from Hollywood, as well as on nearly every New Age story. We see it in Star wars, Lord of The Rings, and films like The Matrix. The dystopian Old World Order is a Prison World, and the hero and his followers must overcome the Prison World to usher in the New Age of Love, Light, and Freedom. The idea is to desire Ascension, a very New Age concept.It is a basic tenet of occultism to apply The Hegelian Dialectic of Problem-Reaction dualities in order to arrive at a subsequent desired outcome: The Solution.In this case, the formula looks like this:1. Problem: The Deep State “Black Hates” are the Dark Magick aspect of the dialectic.2. Reaction: The “White Hat” Q ANON Movement and New Age (Secular Humanist Conspiracy Theorists are the White Magick aspect of the dialectic.)3. Solution: The eradication of The New World Order Deep State in order to usher in The Gnostic Luciferian New Age of Occult Transhumanism.When we hear conspiracy theorists or Trump hint at “The Plan”, the plan they are hinting at is this New Age Ascension, with the desired outcome being the eradication of this Deep State Cabal Dark Force to usher in The Light of Lucifer, the same false light that the Luciferian United Nations has been raving about for decades. Many conspiracies talk about this plan. Alex Jones and David Icke, though much respected for all that they have exposed have really brought everyone to the place where New Age Ascension is desirable. The more they reveal about The Deep State, the more people want to destroy the Deep State and replace it with a more loving alternative…a loving New World Order. They do not lead any to the need of Christ’s sacrifice for Salvation. They talk more about Ascending into The Stars and becoming Godlike though New Age knowledge that The Christian Gospel. Icke more than Jones does this, but they both talk more about an Enlightened Post Illuminati Era than The Gospel of Christ.All of this come right from the playbook, The Externalization of the Hierarchy by New Age leader, Alice A. Bailey. The Holy Bible teaches in Ephesians 6:12 that our battle as born-again Christians is not against flesh and blood, that is, man; but rather, against the forces of darkness, “against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” These demonic powers are known as the “HIERARCHY” in the occult. Certain evil people (who are demon-possessed) known as the “Ascended Masters” are able to convey messages from demons to men. Alice Bailey (1880-1949) was one such “Ascended Master”. She communicated with a demonic being named Master Djwhal Khul, who instructed Bailey and her followers to “prepare men for the reappearance of the Christ. This is your first duty.” (“The Externalization of the Hierarchy,” pg.614).Of course, Alice Bailey's version of “Christ” is the Man of Sin, the coming Antichrist, evidenced by the fact that she mentions “Christ” 666 times in her book titled, The Externalization of the Hierarchy. The hierarchy of demonic powers are being externalized to the world today. That which has been a well-kept secret throughout the ages is now becoming common public knowledge. This is why we see occult symbols in our faces everywhere that we look these days. Satan is preparing the world for the coming of the Antichrist, and I believe it will be very soon.The Great Awakening is actually the world falling asleep to the Luciferian New Age.The Great Falling Asleep would be a better name.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RJ5Z0TUOMF0O1","asin":{"original":"1942790139","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2020","date":{"date":"November 10, 2020","unix":1604970000},"name":"Curious George","rating":1,"title":"Absolute and complete garbage causing so much damage in our society","review":"I just cannot believe that Amazon is selling this.Bezos, if you could find children to sell online, would you?Do you have any standards at all?","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RHV41BITFDFVY","asin":{"original":"1942790139","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020","date":{"date":"November 5, 2020","unix":1604538000},"name":"Rev.

Knee-jerk, emotional, fear-driven responses to situations that leave you feeling powerless is no way to conduct yourself in life; it guarantees repeated failures in understanding actual facts. You don't have to be Albert Einstein to make sure your information has been accurately vetted before you use it. This whole book is a scrambled-egg mess of wild assumptions, childish boogeymen, and what-might-be-lurking-in-the-closet or under the bed in the dark. Adult themes superimposed on the kid nightmare versions, heavily augmented with aberrant sexual, cannibalistic, enslavement and disenfranchisement by a secret cabal of multi-billionaires type of thinking.I weep for what is happening to the country I donned a uniform for; the arrogance of willing ignorance is becoming a tidal wave that's ripping our country apart.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R340Y7WXF4J6RQ","asin":{"original":"1942790139","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2020","date":{"date":"August 23, 2020","unix":1598140800},"name":"anonymous","rating":1,"title":"Cancer infecting the Republican party and Trumpism","review":"What is this conspiracy theory garbage?","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R2IWOKM32GM5LV","asin":{"original":"1942790139","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2020","date":{"date":"August 22, 2020","unix":1598054400},"name":"Michael Gibbert","rating":5,"title":"WOW","review":"Great Information and a Ray of Hope for Humanity.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3U1QY8TN95SCQ","asin":{"original":"1942790139","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2020","date":{"date":"August 22, 2020","unix":1598054400},"name":"M.

At the time, it was widely believed viruses were the root cause of cancer and that a cure for cancer would quickly be found.This turned out to be completely wrong and a causal link between viruses and human cancer remains tenuous at best.(Critics contend the link was \"invented\" by Big Pharma in order to justify the Hepatitis B and the HPV vaccines for profit.)This book describes how the HPV vaccine was heavily promoted and even mandated by some govts; and how anti-HPV vaccine activists have been denounced for questioning the safety and necessity of the vaccine.However, the authors fail to explain WHY this occurred:I recommend reading \"Deadly Medicines and Organized Crime\" by Peter Gotzsche in order to understand the full context of the HPV vaccine.The Gotzsche book describes in insidious detail how Big Pharma money has corrupted govt (at the state and federal level), the media, public health institutions and the scientific community.Big Pharma also heavily skews medical research towards profitable- NOT effective- \"treatments\".This is the real reason the Hepatitis B and HPV vaccines were mandated by some govts.(If government was truly concerned about reducing cancer, then it would ban smoking instead.)The public is also at fault for its BLIND TRUST in doctors/scientists, who have become the new “high priests”.(Most people are simply unaware that ~50% of science/medicine is WRONG!)A mathematician once advised:\"If you understand something and can prove it, then publish it in a mathematics journal.If you understand something, but can't prove it, then publish it in a physics journal.And if you don't understand something and can't prove it, then publish it in an engineering journal.\"To this I would add:\"And if you don't understand something and can't prove it and don't care anyway because you're just trying to make a fast buck, then publish it in a medical journal.\"","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RK48JBBUU1E08","asin":{"original":"1510710809","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2020","date":{"date":"February 3, 2020","unix":1580691600},"name":"purple magical smurf","rating":5,"title":"Hpv vaccine is dangerous","review":"Excellent book.

It begins with the following disclaimer:\"This book contains the opinions and ideas of its authors. It is a source of information only and does not constitute medical, legal, or other advice to the individual reader. Neither the authors nor the publisher are liable or responsible for any injury, loss, or damage allegedly arising from this book.\"(That may be the most accurate statement in the book.)In other words, following the advice in the book can be fatal. Caveat lector, indeed!Here's an example of the problems with the book. Chapter 4, billed as 'a primer on cervical cancer', neglects to mention a significant fact: cervical cancer makes up less than half of the cancer cases caused by HPV in North America [see pubmed 28369882 ]. What a magnificent and efficient technique to minimize the problem addressed by the vaccine - simply ignore most of it!Here's another. Chapter 9 purports to show that the vaccine increases risk of cervical cancer in women already infected with HPV... but fails miserably, as the results they base this claim on are from very small subgroups, none of which reach statistical significance, and are quite likely due to chance. In Gardasil's case, the clinical trials had two subgroups which were HPV positive before vaccination; the larger subgroup didn't have a higher rate of CIN2/3 afterwards, and the smaller subgroup which did turns out to have had a higher rate of positive pap smears even before the trial.You can't prevent a disease which has already started.The whole book is like that; it's just one bit of antivax propaganda after another.If you want accurate health information, try something written by actual medical doctors or researchers, based on accurate medical research, not a book written by people who advocate for quackery.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1B1PLK28CBL6V","asin":{"original":"1510710809","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2019","date":{"date":"September 19, 2019","unix":1568851200},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"title":"Must read.","review":"Great reasource to help make an informed decision.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R84QX63WXAL57","asin":{"original":"1510710809","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2018","date":{"date":"December 13, 2018","unix":1544662800},"name":"Online consumer","rating":5,"title":"Everyone who should read this book...especially, if you vaccinate and believe all vaccines are safe.","review":"Since my physician and I have been discussing this HPV vaccine (Gardasil) shared this book.

Since then, 120 countries including the U.S. have adopted it, with marked success reported in decreasing the prevalence of HPV (human papillomavirus), which is implicated in the development of numerous cancers, including those of the cervix, anus, mouth and throat. In the U.S., despite limited uptake of the vaccine, HPV prevalence has been more than cut in half, with a markedly greater reduction in the age group getting the vaccine. In Australia where most adolescent boys and girls have received the HPV vaccine, the reduction in HPV infection is even more profound - with the prevalence rate among 18 to 24-year old women declining from about 23% to 1% from 2005 to 2015. Since about 99.99% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV, it's anticipated that Australia could in coming years be the first nation to essentially eliminate this cancer entirely.This is great news - but not for antivaccine advocates. In \"The HPV Vaccine On Trial\", longtime antivax campaigner Mary Holland and two coauthors who similarly lack a medical or scientific background attack the HPV vaccine as ineffective, unnecessary and dangerous - but fail miserably to make an effective case.While you won't find this information in the book, lead author Mary Holland has long condemned vaccines as a whole. She co-authored \"Vaccine Epidemic\", a misinformation-filled screed against immunization which included a defense of Andrew Wakefield, the researcher who published an unethical and fraudulent study suggesting a link between MMR vaccine and autism. The paper was later retracted by The Lancet after knowledge of Wakefield's transgressions (including accepting hefty payments from a lawyer's group hoping to file lucrative lawsuits against vaccine makers) became known.\"The HPV Vaccine On Trial\" depends heavily on the same discredited tropes that have been commonly used in other antivax books and articles.Most prominently there are anecdotes about young people who developed ailments somewhere around the time they were vaccinated - in some instances, much later (one case describes a young woman who started getting panic attacks months after HPV vaccination). Another case is that of Colton Berrett, a young man who reportedly had no problems with the first two doses of a three-dose HPV vaccine series, then developed a paralytic syndrome with onset two weeks after his final HPV shot. This ailment (transverse myelitis) has many potential causes, but vaccination has never been shown to be one of them (a study involving 64 million vaccine doses found no association). This hasn't stopped antivaxers from seizing on the sad outcome to Berrett's illness (he took his own life) as a vehicle to attack vaccines.At least the book left out one of the more bizarre attempts to link the HPV vaccine to a death; an antivaccine website contains an account of a young woman who fell down a well and died, one month after being vaccinated.In reality, HPV vaccines have been found to be very safe, with potential side effects mostly limited to minor problems like temporary injection site pain, swelling and redness. Holland et al list a whopping number of ailments alleged to be caused by the vaccine, but there is neither a logical mechanism nor convincing evidence for linking such a multitude of disparate conditions to the vaccine.There isn't space in a single review to cover all the errors and distortions in this book, but examples include the laughable suggestion that HPV infection can be prevented by improved sanitation and clean water (since there are approximately 43,000 new cases of HPV-linked cancer in the U.S. annually, one wonders if Holland et al think the U.S. is a Third World country without access to clean water or sewers). In the case of cervical cancer, close to 100% of cases occur in HPV-infected women, but the book tries to play up the tiny minority of cases where HPV has not been demonstrated, in an attempt to show the vaccine isn't necessary. To that end, the book also claims that the infection \"clears almost all the time\". Consider that there are currently an estimated 80 million Americans with HPV, and about 90% of them will have their infections resolve within two years. That still leaves 7.2 million with persistent infection and the potential for precancerous and cancerous changes. We have no way to predict which infections will spontaneously resolve and which will dangerously persist. The book attempts to present Pap screening as a viable alternative to HPV vaccination. However, Pap tests do not prevent HPV infection - they can only monitor it; and while highly useful they are not perfect, occasionally missing serious abnormalities. Meantime, in addition to 43,000 Americans developing HPV-linked cancers each year, hundreds of thousands of people experience precancerous changes due to HPV, and must undergo costly, invasive and sometimes painful testing and procedures to check for and eliminate dysplasias (precancers.) The morbidity of these conditions is something the book glosses over or ignores entirely. This is a common antivax tactic - focus only on deaths due to disease (rather ghoulishly, antivaxers seem to think these numbers are low enough to be \"manageable\") while refusing to acknowledge complications and suffering due to vaccine-preventable diseases.The book also makes liberal use of the \"toxin gambit\" - claiming that minute amounts of Scary-Sounding Chemicals are responsible for vaccine injuries (there is no viable evidence for such claims; for an excellent takedown of this ploy, search for the Science-Based Medicine article \"Toxic Myths About Vaccines\"). One such pseudo-toxin is blamed for fertility problems alleged to be caused by the vaccine. However, a recent large-scale study debunked the major claim in this area, refuting the idea that premature ovarian failure is linked to HPV vaccination.Ironically, HPV infection itself may damage fertility, i.e. when cervical conization procedures or hysterectomy made necessary by high grade precancers or cancers compromise or eliminate potential for pregnancy. You won't find attention to this problem in the book.Other commonplace antivax tactics that the book employs include references to low quality publications by poorly regarded researchers such as Sin Hang Lee and Yehuda Shoenfeld (whose mouse paper attempting to find fault with a vaccine adjuvant was retracted due to methodologic flaws). A much, much greater amount of quality research in support of immunization is either ignored or attacked as tainted by conflicts of interest. Actually citing good evidence to counter this huge body of positive research (much of it by independent researchers) is apparently too hard for the book's authors - much easier for them to dismiss it via innuendo.Speaking of \"conflicts of interest\": one wonders why, if money rules in the Medical Mafia (as antivaxers like to regard the great majority of physicians), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists promotes HPV vaccination. Consider that for a long time, routine Pap tests have been an income generator for gynecologists, assuring frequent patient visits for health assessments and other reasons. Routine HPV testing (also endorsed by ACOG) and HPV vaccination will greatly cut down on the need for Pap tests, reduce patient visits and deprive gynecologists of significant income. Yet the members of ACOG, because they care deeply about the health of their patients, strongly support HPV vaccination. As the ACOG website notes:\"It is crucial that obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care providers educate parents and patients on the benefits and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and offer HPV vaccines in their offices. A health care provider’s recommendation to vaccinate is a strong influence in parents’ decision making.\"The drug companies that make Gardasil and Cervarix (another HPV vaccine) are potentially sacrificing $$$ that could be made supplying cancer drugs and other pharma products to the many people afflicted by HPV-associated diseases. That doesn't seem to occur to the authors of this book.Meantime, on the horizon are new and improved HPV vaccines targeting even more virus subtypes (the current version of Gardasil targets 92% of the high-risk HPV strains), and vaccines to treat HPV-induced cancers. Antivaxers dread the idea of widespread use of anticancer vaccines, perhaps because they know it'll be a lot tougher to get the public to avoid an effective means of preventing or treating widespread deadly malignancies, as opposed to vaccine-preventable diseases like polio and measles which don't seem as important to modern parents who've never had to experience children made miserable or deathly ill by them.Whether you choose to buy Holland's book or (like me) save money by reading a library copy, know that there are much better, fair-minded and accurate sources of information on the Internet. Particularly recommended are Science-Based Medicine, immunize.org, pkids.org, and the website on immunization sponsored by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. For a book that answers virtually any question you might have on vaccines, using facts and good evidence while not taking sides on \"the controversy\", read Kristen Feemster's \"Vaccines: What Everyone Needs To Know\".Update: claims that the HPV vaccine's effectiveness is unproven have taken a hit, with news that rates of precancerous lesions caused by HPV have declined dramatically, thanks to vaccination. A study published in the British Medical Journal reports major reductions in precancerous cervical lesions among young women who were vaccinated against HPV - up to an 88% drop in high grade cervical dysplasias caused by the virus.And a new report from the CDC has demonstrated huge drops in HPV infection rates in the U.S. following vaccine introduction.Even more data from Finland and Japan shows HPV vaccination is sharply reducing cervical neoplasia caused by HPV.June 2019 update: a new comprehensive review confirms that 1) HPV vaccination has greatly lowered HPV infection rates and the incidence of serious precancerous lesions caused by the virus, and 2) decreased infection rates in unvaccinated people, thanks to greater herd immunity.November 2019 update: Two more published studies demonstrate the safety of HPV vaccination, both in the journal Pediatrics. Excerpt from one of the studies:''VAERS received 7244 reports after (Gardasil): 31.2% among females, 21.6% among males, and for 47.2%, sex was not reported. Overall, 97.4% of reports were nonserious. Dizziness, syncope, headache, and injection site reactions were most commonly reported...CONCLUSIONS:No new or unexpected safety concerns or reporting patterns of (Gardasil) with clinically important (adverse events) were detected. The safety profile of (Gardasil) is consistent with data from prelicensure trials and from postmarketing safety data of its predecessor, the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine.''- Safety of the 9-Valent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine.Shimabukuro TT1, Su JR2, Marquez PL2, Mba-Jonas A3, Arana JE2, Cano MV2.2020 update: Long-term followup of young Scandinavian women receiving the HPV vaccine (in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study) shows impressive effectiveness of the vaccine. Excerpt from a report in The Lancet: \"No cases of HPV16/18-related high-grade cervical dysplasia were observed in the per-protocol effectiveness population (N = 2121; 24,099·0 person-years of follow-up) during the entire study. Vaccine effectiveness of 100% (95% CI 94·7–100) was demonstrated for ≥12 years, with a trend toward continued protection through 14 years post-vaccination... There was no evidence of waning immunity, suggesting no need for a booster dose during that period.\"September 2020: One of the largest studies to date to look at whether autonomic dysfunction is associated with HPV vaccination (Hviid et al, British Medical Journal) found no association between vaccination and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), complex regional pain syndrome, or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. In fact, CFS was a little over a third as common in HPV vaccine recipients compared to the unvaccinated, a considerably lower incidence.Meanwhile, the FDA has expanded the indication of Gardasil-9 to include prevention of oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. The benefits of this vaccine extend far beyond preventing cervical cancer.Results from around the world confirm that HPV vaccination is safe and effective.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1M2IPXXL68PVJ","asin":{"original":"1510710809","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2019","date":{"date":"January 26, 2019","unix":1548464400},"name":"Carol Taylor","rating":5,"title":"Health and Vaccines","review":"Vaccines are deadly!!!!!!!!! great way for Big Pharma to make us Sick......for they can make more money from diseasethey help create","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1A2WIUECTUQCJ","asin":{"original":"1510710809","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2019","date":{"date":"January 19, 2019","unix":1547859600},"name":"PSantO","rating":1,"title":"Poor evidence, great for the conspiracy theorist","review":"Poor evidence, great for the conspiracy theorist","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R2S0X95ZHS1PMU","asin":{"original":"1510710809","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2019","date":{"date":"January 19, 2019","unix":1547859600},"name":"customer","rating":5,"title":"Must read!!

Lockdowns on Trial is hands down the best of the bunch.I'm really grateful to have found this work; it's an excellent summary of what led societies around the world to a state of collective hysteria, and to some of them implementing draconian measures like hard lockdowns. At the same time, it's a careful review of the politicization of the issue in the United States, without injecting his own assumptions into the matter. These days, that's not an easy task.What really drives the author, and what makes this book stand out, is the data. After considering the models that led many governments to take harsh measures, Michael then contrasts those models with the evidence of the Diamond Princess cruise, and the first countries to have experienced their COVID-19 peak. His case against lockdowns is made clearly and with no appeals to emotion.Having experienced a hard lockdown myself in Chile, with curfews and an unbelievable curtailment of freedoms (that surely in a different time would have been seen as a violation of human rights), I lament that the message of looking at the evidence to judge the efficacy of lockdowns is missing in most of the world. This book is a step in that direction.We need more people like Michael to start standing up against draconian measures, not only because they go against liberal principles in democratic societies, but simply because they don't work. If lockdowns were such an incredible silver bullet by themselves, all of the countries that implemented them (including mine) would have crushed the virus today, months after most of them started doing them.

Massachusetts, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a state criminal law that required all adult inhabitants of Cambridge to get a smallpox vaccine or be fined. The Supreme Court explained that an individual's liberty rights under the U.S. Constitution are not absolute and the mandatory vaccination law was necessary to promote public health and safety.While Jacobson v. Massachusetts is over 100 years old, courts continue to rely on the reasoning of the case. State governments still occasionally enact broad compulsory vaccination policies. In 2019, in the midst of a measles outbreak, New York City mandated that anyone over six months of age who lived, went to school or worked in several ZIP codes within the city had to be vaccinated against measles or be subject to a fine.At this time there are discussions around forcing people to take the Covid vaccine when available. This is an issue because there are ways to avoid catching it such as by taking Zinc daily and Hydroxychloroquine 2x week. Unfortunately Big Pharma companies got two papers based on false data published. Even though the both were retracted it was too late to stop the World Health Organization from halting all studies on use of Hydroxychloroquine for Covid treatement.If you don't believe me then do your own research using independentnew organizations not tied to Big Pharma advertisers.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RGU5B24H13L3C","asin":{"original":"B00HSSRK1E","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2020","date":{"date":"August 7, 2020","unix":1596758400},"name":"MaryP","rating":5,"title":"Easy read, informative.","review":"Dr. Vernon Coleman has good information.

The state of science reporting on certain critical topics--AIDS, and another disease that emerged simultaneously in the late-1970s -early 1980s, \"CFS,\" now known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis--was less than stellar from the start.Journalists seemed to lose their critical faculties around virologists or epidemiologists, especially if they worked at the Centers for Disease Control or the National Institutes of Health. Stenography vs. critical inquiry was prominent, as if scientists were super-humans, incapable of mistakes or dishonesty. Ortleb was different. He founded and published the New York Native early in the 1980s, New York's most influential gay newspaper at the time. The Native was supposed to be fun and diverting, and for a while it was.But Ortleb quickly dedicated himself to covering the best-known of the two epidemics, AIDS, eventually turning his focus to the outbreak with a passion. His deconstruction of the scientists involved in setting national policies about AIDS during that era is found in this short book, and for that the read alone is worth the modest price. You will not find Ortleb's perspicacity and to-the-point observations anywhere else. Whatever the opposite of slavish awe, that is the vantage from which Ortleb wisely operates.In this story that is mostly about Tony Fauci, Ortleb describes the march toward naming the retrovirus HIV as the cause of AIDS, describing the logistical and sleight of hand tactics undertaken by Fauci and colleagues in demolishing the notion of retrovirologist Peter Duesberg, UC Berkeley's expert, who insisted the paradigm of HIV infection was wrong. Whatever your view on this controversial topic, Ortleb's discussion of the fight for the dominant theory of AIDS is fascinating. And likely Ortleb's point would be, it's not a contest of opinion but a contest of facts. In Ortleb's view, the facts never added up.Add to this story the emergence of another infectious disease, one that also devastated the immune systems of sufferers and caused myriad disabling symptoms--one that, unlike AIDS, went unstudied and, therefore, untreated from the 1980s into the present. Millions of Americans have been disabled for literally decades as a result. The Center for Disease held a meeting in 1987 and decided to rename this disease \"chronic fatigue syndrome\" in what was a remarkably successful effort to defang it, turning the malady into a personality disorder rather than an organic disease worthy of immediate attention. Less well known is that CDC officials were marching in tandem with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Fauci's agency within NIH. Fauci is probably the most powerful of the power brokers who pulled strings to disappear the second disease. It was simply too inconvenient, Ortleb argues, to have a disease that if closely examined, would undercut the dominant paradigm of AIDS at the time.Ortleb believes it and AIDS are part of a collection of related diseases, including autism, certain cancers and other chronic neurological diseases, likely caused by a herpes virus, HHV-6 and possibly other related herpes viruses. That AIDS and \"CFS\" were bifurcated, in Ortleb's hands, is part of the tragedy and public health crisis created by the cabal, led by Fauci, of arrogant, white male \"heterosexist\" government scientists he describes here.As the author of another book about the second disease, what Ortleb and others have called \"non-HIV AIDS,\" I respect Ortleb's willingness to take on this fraught subject and strip away the government doublespeak that has, excuse the expression, plagued both diseases.And though it may be irrelevant here, I'll add thatI have a great deal of respect for Ortleb for another reason. He is probably the sole living journalist who has used my book Osler's Web as a resource and properly cited it in the text of his own work instead of passing passages from O.W. off as his own. Ortleb is the kind of old school ethical journalist one rarely sees in science journalism these days.Ortleb, who has obviously read any number of important books about medical ethics and history, enriches his prose by nailing down his factual material and then widening his lens with ideas expressed in philosophical texts, in particular the \"Science of Scientific Revolutions\" by Thomas Kuhn.In sum, Ortleb's book on Fauci is rich with detail and ideas that will fascinate anyone with curiosity about not only the early days of the AIDS epidemic, but the larger, certainly topical, matter of emerging infectious diseases. Not to mention, his is a kind of inadvertent textbook on how powerful government scientists manage to disappear such diseases they find inconvenient or simply bothersome.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1WVF4P2ET3WC0","asin":{"original":"B086C33Y64","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020","date":{"date":"November 9, 2020","unix":1604883600},"name":"katherinereitsch haas","rating":1,"title":"Disappointed not worth a one star","review":"Very disappointed in the book and it’s represents of Dr. Fauci not worth the read and disappointed that it is offered by Amazon although someone else might like his point of biew","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R23BW7JPD9GR4G","asin":{"original":"B086C33Y64","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020","date":{"date":"November 4, 2020","unix":1604451600},"name":"MATIJA","rating":5,"title":"Fauci for prison","review":"Great expose of this demon Fauci.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R212VQI356N9JT","asin":{"original":"B086C33Y64","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020","date":{"date":"October 28, 2020","unix":1603846800},"name":"Justina Pfister","rating":1,"title":"Inaccurate","review":"Unfortunately not a very credible read","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RR65UGNTYDOS9","asin":{"original":"B086C33Y64","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2020","date":{"date":"October 27, 2020","unix":1603760400},"name":"leeann","rating":2,"title":"Little to no facts presented","review":"This is mostly an opinion booklet.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1BN4F25E1HYB","asin":{"original":"B086C33Y64","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in Canada on June 16, 2020","date":{"date":"June 16, 2020","unix":1592265600},"name":"Carol Taylor","title":"DR FAUCI","review":"AFTER READING THIS MAN HE SHOULD BE IN JAILMAKES THINGS UP AS HE GOES","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1KJNPPWJBPZ70","asin":{"original":"B086C33Y64","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on May 6, 2020","date":{"date":"May 6, 2020","unix":1588723200},"name":"K.

In chapter after chapter, the author makes basically the same point.The one thing that does keep it from being too repetitive is the first-hand accounts he gives of dealing with patients.This book was written in 2005 when the Iraq war was ramping up and the memories of 9/11 were still fresh in everyone's minds.It would be interesting to see a follow up to this book.I think that many of the things that are used to scare us have changed ( there is no more terrorist threat level chart) fear is still used to manipulate the American public often for political ends.This book is interesting if slightly outdated read that anyone who is interested in how the public can be manipulated through fear.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3DU27O6ULABUA","asin":{"original":"0470053844","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2016","date":{"date":"December 10, 2016","unix":1481331600},"name":"Kindle Customer","rating":5,"title":"Five Stars","review":"I found this book very interesting.

Dr. Siegel confuses actions our society should take based on absolute risk (public health measures) and how individuals should act based on accepted risk. The risks that we gladly assume (such as driving a car) are far different than than the risks we are forced to endure (such as a terrorist attack or radiation exposure from a nuclear power plant), even though the latter risks may be much smaller than the former. The failure to discuss voluntary vs. involuntary assumption of personal risk is a major failing of the book.I doubt the existence of a dastardly politico-media complex that is out to ruin and/or control our lives that Dr. Siegel seems to suggest. If such a conspiracy were as blatant as he supposes, there should be more evidence. I have no problem with people who choose to believe such.

But much of it is common sense, and most of the rest you could dig up yourself with a few Google searches.Siegel's real purpose in publishing this book becomes clear a couple chapters in. He launches into a steady barrage of criticism of the Bush administration, Republican politicians, and big business.Now, there is plenty of legitimate criticism that can be leveled at the aforementioned. But for proper perspective, it needs to be balanced by acknowledging that fearmongering is a bipartisan pursuit. But Siegel completely ignores the various bogeymen of the left, which are even more egregious examples of irrational fearmongering.Every couple years the environmental movement launches a new scare campaign de jour. Alar, dioxin, power lines, irradiated food, ozone depletion, secondhand smoke--all of them either completely debunked or shown to be manageable risks. But not a whisper from Siegel about any of them. The AIDS epidemic in America was oversold with junk science, at one point Donna Shalala warning that there may be \"no Americans left\". But Siegel cites AIDS as an example of a risk that is UNDER-reported. And of course, he has to get in his digs at the NRA, taking a purely partisan position on the issue of gun ownership and dabbling in some fearmongering of his own.After dozens of pages bashing Bush, and pausing to gush praise upon Al Gore, the book settles into routine discussions of bird flu, SARS, etc., though he takes one more shot at Bush later in the book (rehashing the WMD debate). By the end of this book, your attitude toward the book will depend upon your political persuasion. If you are a Democratic sympathizer, you'll probably give the book a thumbs up, being vaguely aware that it was written by a fellow traveler (thereby casting a glow upon the entire work). If you are in the GOP camp, you probably tossed the book away in disgust long before the end. If you're not political, you'll be bored out of your skull.For a genuine hard-hitting look at the culture of junk science and fearmongering, the works of Michael Fumento are highly recommended.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RZ8RGGCF6MDV","asin":{"original":"0470053844","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2020","date":{"date":"November 15, 2020","unix":1605402000},"name":"Whitney","rating":3,"title":"Its alright","review":"This book is alright.

(People with no particular ties to the Gulf Coast have told me they watched around the clock before, during, and after Katrina and Rita, and they looked haggard.) Marc Siegel doesn't deny that bad things happen, but he puts things in perspective. This book is an extremely well-written users' manual for dealing with fear.

I'm writing this as Hurricane Rita is headed towards the Gulf Coast somewhere. Hurricanes happen. They come in all along the Gulf Coast. Katrina came in to New Orleans, well, actually it didn't hit New Orleans but the high water came. (Politicians don't like to spend money on things like maintenance of the levies.)Now comes Rita. Last night Rita was headed to Galveston. A million people left. Now Rita is projected to hit somewhere quite a ways east of Galveston. The western side of a hurricane is usually beautiful weather. The million people will decide that they shouldn't have gone through the effort (a normal 2 hour drive took 12 hours). Over the next few years the whole thing will have faded into the past. Ten years from now, another hurricane will come in that way. People won't leave.Dr. Siegel says that our fears come from three sources:The Government - if politicians can create a crisis and then fix it ....The Media - the hype about Rita today is nothing less than fantastic.The Big Drug Companies - How many ads have you seen on TV lately about illnesses that you never even heard of before?Terrorism, yes it killed about 3,000 people one day in 2001. But we kill about 4,000 every month in automobile accidents. Why are we so concerned about terrorism (making airline flights impossibly difficult - go pay cash for a one way ticket and watch what happens to you) and there are no thoughts at all about making the cars and the roads safer?It's a funny world, and Dr. Siegel tries to bring a bit of sanity to our lives.

Second, the chicken little, the sky is falling phenomenon causes us to become cynical about real warnings.

Johnson cited all kinds of statistics to basically call anyone who feared a terrorist attack in the USA a fool. I am sure this was great comfort to the 3,000 people who went to work in the NY World Trade center two months later and had a choice of jumping to their deaths or burning to death before the towers fell on the pulverized remains of the terrorists who had hijacked the aircraft used to kill more American civilians than had ever occurred before in the nation's history.Now we have a medical doctor, Marc Siegel, telling us the same thing in 200 pages of nonsense.Siegel does not use the Dr. title, wisely, in giving his advice, since he would probably never be able to practice medicine again once the law suits started after the next terrorist attack, but this is really a very silly book.Siegel is right in his recitation of statistics in reminding us that we have a better chance of being killed in a car crash than a terrorist attack, so far. And he is correct in pointing out the sensationalism rampant in the liberal media when it over hypes stories about SARS, etc. But his political agenda convolutes reasoning in a very dangerous world, where terrorism has replaced historical methods of warfare, just as nitrates replaced bows and arrows as weapons of destruction decades ago.Thankfully this book is a one hour read at best, but get your lawyer ready to make you some money after the next terrorist attack and you can convince a jury that you believed this nonsense and didn't fear jihadist lunatics after reading Siegel's shallow and ridiculous book.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RVS5DWYBZ292H","asin":{"original":"0470053844","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2005","date":{"date":"September 6, 2005","unix":1125964800},"name":"FrKurt Messick","rating":5,"title":"Living in history, living in reality","review":"We live in a media-saturated culture, and that media is increasingly given to exploiting the most fantastic, the most gruesome, and the most dire in an effort to get ratings.If it bleeds, it leads.Similar impulses tend to dominate political speech - rhetoric for calling people to war on terrorism, war on drugs, war on whatever the 'glamour' issue is can tend toward the worst-case scenario being heightened as the most likely occurrence.However, the truth is that the worst case scenario rarely happens, and even when it does, it pales by a realistic comparison to the way the world is as a whole.For example, author Marc Siegel discusses the media and popular panic over the outbreak of SARS - one would think that this is the next worldwide pandemic just waiting to break, and public and governmental pressure was brought to bear to deal with this.In reality, few people died from SARS, it turned out that SARS was not that infectious, and in fact more people die of the regular flu virus annually than did of SARS.This is but one example of how we as a culture tend to get distracted by a high-profile issue.The fear of people in the West about terrorism is a similar false alarm, in Siegel's estimation.It is still true that one is far more likely to get killed or injured in traffic accidents or workplace accidents than by any terrorism related; to devote one's resources (physical and psychological) toward an event unlikely to happen to the exclusion of dealing with the likely events is a problem our society increasingly faces.Siegel's plea is that we as a society and as a global community pay attention to those things that are more likely to happen (even if they aren't glamourous and don't play well in front of the camera) and not spend all our time and resources on the things we cannot change - a bit like the serenity prayer writ large (change the things we can, accept the things we can't, and have the wisdom to know the difference).This is an important book.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"ROH3UL5DU2HAU","asin":{"original":"0470053844","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2005","date":{"date":"August 31, 2005","unix":1125446400},"name":"Henry Michaels","rating":5,"title":"A valuable perspective","review":"There is a lot to learn from historical perspective - if only we could learn it while the history is happening.This book helps accomplish exactly that.Siegel examines personal and societal fear through a physician's eye - first studying and understanding the mechanisms which we experience as fear, and then examining and diagnosing how we've been using those mechanisms.The perspective and lessons are insightful and useful, making this a worthwhile read.It is also an easy read, peppered with case studies and stories which make it enjoyable while addressing this serious subject.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3AUT686O0DFVN","asin":{"original":"0470053844","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2005","date":{"date":"August 20, 2005","unix":1124496000},"name":"mwest","rating":5,"title":"Excellent reality check","review":"Yea, we're all afraid of terrorism, diseases, death, and violence... but who would have guessed that the real threat to our health was the fear impulse spurred on by these nebulous and rare events?This book introduces us to the real stories behind the terrors - a welcome message in the midst of alarmist media and drug company marketing ploys.Siegel masterfully introduces us to the reality of the situation, and reminds us of the real issues that Americans face today - a message sorely missed and needed in our culture.An excellent read - and a welcome relief - for anyone living in today's culture of mass media sound bites and goverment issued terror alerts.","verified_purchase":false}],"asin":"0470053844"},{"total_reviews":14,"stars_stat":{"1":"16%","2":"0%","3":"0%","4":"16%","5":"68%"},"result":[{"id":"R2V013MAF0HXP4","asin":{"original":"0935047948","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2020","date":{"date":"December 17, 2020","unix":1608166800},"name":"timothy johnson","rating":1,"title":"Lies!","review":"Lies!","verified_purchase":false}],"asin":"0935047948"},{"total_reviews":202,"stars_stat":{"1":"1%","2":"2%","3":"2%","4":"8%","5":"87%"},"result":[{"id":"R1ISS061MD342N","asin":{"original":"B087CLDWFB","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2020","date":{"date":"November 20, 2020","unix":1605834000},"name":"C.

To get past this catastrophe we will need to forgive, but we should never forget. We should do whatever we can to dismantle such experts’ unchecked power over public policy.”“These experts, however, could never have done so much damage without a gullible, self-righteous, and weaponized media that spread their projections far and wide.

They served up apocalyptic clickbait by the hour and the ton.”“COVID-19 will go down in history, but not for the number of deaths it caused.All death brings pain, but as far as historic pandemics go, the coronavirus was unremarkable.

Also, it is a shame people receive no education on statistics. As others have pointed out, graphs and models and numbers aren't science, and data can be tortured to prove anything. This book gives a rigorous lesson in statistics that is much needed.Many important issues are addressed in this book — and this book isn't about politics like some of the fake reviewers assert.When countries in East Asia, countries that have the most experience with pandemics, didn't institute extreme lockdowns, why were they ignored and dismissed? Are leaders in the rest of the world that incompetent, self-assured in their wisdom, or just outright malicious?Whatever the case may be, those other countries succeeded, yet we still see \"leaders\" and \"experts\" elsewhere making the same mistakes over and over again.The annointed experts want you to believe you can't think for yourself, or test their claims.

One is to react too slowly. The other is to panic and overreact.These three writers -- first-class, published experts working in their respective fields -- chronicle why America’s \"pilots and crew\" panicked (chs 1-9), and how that overreaction caused and continues to cause more and longer lasting damage to the public health than the novel virus itself (chs 10-13). Both of these stories and especially the latter have been either un- or underreported by an irresponsible media (with the exception of the WSJ, the only paper of national report that resisted and countered the “official” story from the beginning; special shout out to Holman Jenkins).This book is aimed at independent thinkers -- anyone who trusts her own eyes and thoughts and has intuited by now that she is getting only half the available “science” from her little screen, and the little “science” she is getting is being handled in remarkably unscientific ways.At 200 pages the book is just the right length to be thorough yet continually coming to the point; there are graphs and charts but not too many, all perfectly understandable and relevant; the references are brilliant, easy to retrieve and verify, with few if any specialized “science journal” articles in sight. The book cover has a slightly sinister vibe which might mislead a potential reader, though I suppose it’s somewhat justified given the word “tyranny” in the subtitle.But you should ignore it. The writers are scientists, not polemicists, with a refreshing sense of modesty about what science can and cannot do and say. Their style is even-handed and fair but not above an occasional ironic statement or maybe even an eye-roll. I would even say the book is “pleasant” to read if that word didn’t seem so out of place for the subject matter.It is precisely to avoid overreacting that airlines educate and drill their pilots constantly in simulators on the ground, so that in the event of a real emergency in the sky they will respond with swift, calm, well-rehearsed actions. And that’s what makes the most important chapter of The Price of Panic the short penultimate one (14).There the authors list nine “lessons” that the all of us need to learn over and over so that when the next crisis comes -- and it will come -- we don’t make matters worse again because we panicked.

It's rare you get a book that is searching, thoughtful AND utterly timely. The Price of Panic is all of the above.To be clear, it isn't a screed against expertise. Instead, the authors argue that responding intelligently to the pandemic requires too many different kinds of expertise (epidemiology, pharmaceutical science, economics, political economy, foreign policy, sociology, history, etc.) to trust any one type of expert to provide THE policy prescription for the coronavirus pandemic, or for any future pandemic. Different types of relevant expertise have to be weighed in pursuit of the common good, and decisions have to be made with the humble recognition that sweeping edicts always come with unintended consequences. People also have mixed motives. No human is an unfallen angel, so it's a bad idea to trust any one expert or group of experts blindly. Ditto the permanent bureaucracy in Washington overseeing the seemingly endless growth of big government. Axe, Briggs, and Richards stand athwart the trend and cry “stop!” (William F. Buckley Jr. would be proud.) The book doesn't just assert all these points. It dramatically illustrates them.Also, and as The Price of Panic underscores, even our top experts in a given field don't all agree. Media claims of an expert consensus are fiction. For that matter, many a top expert doesn't even agree with himself from one month to the next. Ditto expert organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), which changed its position on masks and is now warning countries that lockdown overkill can cause great harm, particularly to the poor.I lack the expertise to vet every claim the three authors make, but I am a book editor who previously taught writing an argument as a university professor, so I will speak to that. I found that they did a good job of supporting claims with logic, evidence, and clear sourcing.Axe, Briggs, and Richards bring together an impressive suite of complementary backgrounds and research skills. They've provided a valuable one-stop overview of what went right, what went wrong, and what we can learn going forward. I highly recommend the Price of Panic--good medicine.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1I5T1ODKI1IZ0","asin":{"original":"B087CLDWFB","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2020","date":{"date":"October 13, 2020","unix":1602547200},"name":"Clay Garner","rating":5,"title":"“If you torture data long enough, it will confess to anything.’’ —Ronald Coase","review":"“If you torture data long enough, it will confess to anything.’’—Ronald CoaseThis is a world famous economist. He would know.Why good motive so dangerous? Only want to help!“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victim may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated, but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their conscience. —C. S. LewisMoral arrogance is oppressive. Human free-will gives dignity. Therefore, more authority removes personal choice, the more destructive.Why? Ignorance is infinite. Knowledge is scarce.If ignorance so vast, what should be required?“Highlighting unintended consequences is perhaps the greatest gift economics has given to humanity.’’Why so rare to assume unintended results?“There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one,” wrote French economist Frédéric Bastiat.Only one?“The bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen.”He explains: “Yet this difference is tremendous; for it almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa. Whence it follows that the bad economist pursues a small present good that will be followed by a great evil to come, while the good economist pursues a great good to come, at the risk of a small present evil.” Alas, the good economist has limited use in politics. Politicians tend to focus on the visible—the seen—since the unseen does little to help their prospects for reelection.’’Bastiat still almost unknown. Not because proven wrong, but, because painfully correct!What happened?“The World Health Organization (WHO) favored a single, untested, apocalyptic model from Imperial College London. The United States government took its cues from the Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. We now know these models were so wrong they were like shots in the dark. After a few months, even the press admitted as much. But by then vast damage had been done.’’Models now known as painfully, sadly, completely wrong! Change decisions? Nope!“As we’ll see, that’s not true. Whether we compare countries or U.S. states, the virus seemed indifferent to government-mandated lockdowns. Not only did the models exaggerate the danger, but our response to that danger, both voluntary and coerced, exacted great pain for little or no gain. That may sound baffling. How could a nationwide shutdown not stop or at least greatly slow a contagious virus? But as we’ll see, there is no evidence it did.’’Evidence not same as conclusions. Observation must always be interpreted. Honestly. Sincerely. Carefully. Who does that?Models are not data. Spreadsheets are not facts. Computers are not wise.“But what of those experts? They treated predictive models—which are at best complex conjectures about future events—as if they were data. And then, when the models flopped, they began to massage the data. To get past this catastrophe we will need to forgive, but we should never forget. We should do whatever we can to dismantle such experts’ unchecked power over public policy.’’Forgive. Never forget.“These experts, however, could never have done so much damage without a gullible, self-righteous, and weaponized media that spread their projections far and wide. The press carpet-bombed the world with stories about impending shortages of hospital beds, ventilators, and emergency room capacity. They served up apocalyptic clickbait by the hour and the ton.’’Social media important?“In 2009, Twitter claimed 23.5 million users.8 By 2020, the platform had 330 million monthly and 145 million daily users. Instagram started in 2010, just after the swine flu pandemic. It quickly garnered 30 million users. By 2020, it had 1 billion monthly and 500 million daily users. Facebook had 350 million global users by the end of 2009, and by 2020 this had leapt to 1.69 billion. YouTube grew to more than 2 billion monthly users and 1 billion hours of content viewed daily by 2020.”Yep, it’s overwhelming!Fascinating example . . .“History shows that you will rarely lose your job making predictions if you’re wrong in the right direction. On the other hand, you may well lose it if you’re right in the wrong direction. Neither rulers nor subjects welcome the bearer of bad, but true, news. (Especially if it’s bad news for power-grabbing elites.)“I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.”“So complained the Prophet Elijah to God, when he was fleeing for his life from power-couple Ahab and Jezebel. Elijah predicted a drought: “Now Elijah said ‘As the Lord the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word.’ ”Well . . . can prepare. Right?“However right he was, no one wanted to hear what Elijah had to say. No one thanked him when the prophesied drought came to pass. Being wrong in the right direction, though, often reaps reward. Early pandemic models indicated that only prompt and massive state action could save us. The models were wrong—way off—but they were wrong in the right direction.’’What’s the preferred way?“They gave politicians justification for taking over almost every aspect of citizens’ lives. They gave the press clickbait galore. We’re not assuming malice here. We assume that many of these folks were moved by concern and even love for others. The issue is one of incentives and human nature, not bad intentions.’’Authors even handed, but clear and persuasive.Careful is good. Well . . . Who should be careful?“Here’s where the precautionary principle gets twisted from “Don’t play God” to “trust me—I’m a god.” By sleight of hand, the experts become oracles: to doubt their advice is to take foolish risks. The experts become gods, and any mere mortal who questions them is therefore playing god. Only in this light could lockdowns cease to be risks that carry a burden of proof. Instead, the skeptics who doubt them must bear that burden. This inverted precautionary principle gives the experts license to imagine the worst-case scenario and then to agitate the government and the public to safeguard against this worst case. The mere chance that a disaster might happen is enough to justify any and all recommendations from the divine experts.’’The loss of biblical trust replaced with trust in spreadsheets.Writing tastes like good solid meal.

It is not an exagerration to say that corporations have lobbied and gotten laws passed to make it illegal to share basic information with the public on the link between nutritional deficiencies and diseases.The agenda is clear: sell more pharmaceuticals instead and keep expensive drug sales up for the benefit of corporations and shareholders.I echo other readers in their praise of _Dissolving Illusions_ by Dr. Suzanne Humphries for those who want to go in depth into how all of this actually works.The bottom line, demonstrated by this book, is that vaccines didn't save us. No vaccine has been double blind, placebo controlled and tested to make sure it actually prevents the disease or that it is safe. No long term study has been done on health outcomes of a vaccinated population vs. a vaccine free population, although there are certainly enough vaccine free individuals to comprise a control group.In fact, in many families where there are multiple children, sharing genetics, diet and environment, you discover that the first child or two, vaccinated, will be sick, often with autoimmune disorders affecting them for a lifetime. Their younger siblings, vaccine free, are typically the picture of good health.Each person must make the vaccine decision for themselves.

And that particular chapter says nothing about how vaccines wreck immunity. It should have been called something like: \"The Brainwashing Power of the Medical Establishment,\" or just: \"Introduction.\"2) The author, Dr Jack, says about autism: \"…one decade ago the autism rate was one in 10,000.But several other sources tell me the rate was one in 10,000 about FIVE DECADES AGO, not one decade. And the current rate in the US is about one in 100 (girls a bit higher number, boys lower).3) The only specific disease this ebook goes into in any detail is polio. There is a chapter on it, but the information is very incomplete and rather misleading. The graph shows too short a time period -- basically the 1940s on to when the Salk vaccine came on line in 1955. The author says, \"… the main culprit of polio was high sugar intake by its victims.\" Well, that was ONE factor, but there was a combination of several nutritional factors, plus at least two pesticides involved! Not mentioned by Dr Jack is that the epidemic period coincided with extensive use of DDT, which was sometimes even being intentionally sprayed on children. Later it was found that DDT contributed to paralysis which was labeled as polio. Also not mentioned is the fact that as soon as the polio vaccine came out the government changed the diagnostic criteria which gave a false appearance of much less cases. Suffice to say that the polio story is very complicated. The author should have at least hinted of the complexity, but he over-simplifies in such a way as to be a bit misleading. But if I cut him some slack, his polio comments are roughly correct. (See Dr Suzanne Humphries' book, Dissolving Illusions, for a detailed account.)4) \"Any honest immunologist, communicable disease specialist, or public health official will tell you why babies are vaccinated prior to one year of age. It is simply to train the parents to bring their children into the doctor’s office for inoculations.\" There's more to it than that, but it IS a horrible practice to give infants a barrage on inoculations during the first year of life for other reasons provided in this book.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~HOW THIS EBOOK EXCELS:I came to this ebook already fairly knowledgeable about vaccines having read several other books and having done considerable internet research. One of the best books I read is Dr. Suzanne Humphries' book, Dissolving Illusions. Both Dr Humphries and Dr Jack discuss infant, innate, and acquired immunity. Theyboth discuss the two types of innate immunity: cellular and humoral. Humphries' 400 page book goes into much more detail, of course. Humphries discusses things like \"antibody dependent enhancement\" and \"original antigenic sin.\" Her descriptions are complex and expressed in such a way as to be rather confusing (but ultimately accurate). However, Dr Jack does an excellent job of cutting though confusing details to clearly present the essentials.The gold of this ebook is the chapter called, \"The Calculated Disruption of Your Immune System,\" which is basically about how vaccines can mess up our natural immune system, and how vaccines have caused a tremendous increase in autoimmune diseases over the last 50 years. Dr Jack provides clear clean information for helping the layperson to develop a good understanding of some basic problems with vaccines.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R30REKZDPON8Q7","asin":{"original":"B013RYIONU","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2015","date":{"date":"August 19, 2015","unix":1439942400},"name":"Livebetter","rating":5,"title":"I'm so glad there's people getting the truth out there and I ...","review":"Being a mother of young children I get so much pressure to vaccinate my kids.

As well, even things I was already familiar with, like the myth of polio, are poorly presented. In this specific example, the author mentions the connection of children eating sugar and getting polio, but they fail to provide the most important point - that the sugar at that time was contaminated with poisons that allow the polio virus to enter the spine and cause paralysis. I generally agree with the author that vaccines have been more harmful than good, but this book does a poor job at demonstrating that, especially if the reader were unfamiliar with the topic. I'd recommend Vaccine Illusion by Tetyana Obukhanych if you want a high level overview of the major issues with vaccines. That book is well cited and we'll written, but easily readable in a few hours or less.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R24CP6H2Q6OKAC","asin":{"original":"B013RYIONU","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2019","date":{"date":"March 1, 2019","unix":1551402000},"name":"Rachael Unger","rating":5,"title":"Neat","review":"Really interesting read.

Everything you ever need to be able to carry on a normal life without wearing a mask. And there is no such thing as a normal life with a mask. One of my doctors is a neurologist.

This is a good reference that has gathered a lot of scientific studies to support their main points, so it is useful for anyone who is wondering, for example, whether certain mainstream claims are true about modern medicine. You will find out that much of what is assumed to be true has actually not been proven at all, and in many cases, the scientific truth is just the opposite. Modern medicine and science is becoming more of a religion than a search for truth.Reading this has helped me to get a more holistic view of health and understand why my resistance to allopathy was intuitively correct, and maybe too kind, even.Now about the shortcomings. The book is in dire need of editing, a good cover and just some basic polish to make it more readable. That's not a big minus, but it does make it a harder read. The biggest issue I have is that these authors, while they have done a lot of great research, are not trained enough in biology and health to make believable conclusions about the way things really are instead of the way we've been told. Their point of view is certainly more informed than the conventional one, but because they have only gone into depth on specific topics, they lack the ability to create a broad overview of how disease actually happens.To their credit, they don't claim to have the answer to that question, though they take a stab at it. My concern is that their theory is incomplete, partly because so little research has been funded on this subject, but also due to their not being trained in seeing health and biology as a whole. Kind of like someone peddling a single supplement as the cure for everything. Health is far more complex than we know, and we have to be careful about overstating what we know at this point.In spite of that, this book is an excellent reference for health care professionals and those who want to understand what's so wrong with today's paradigm of health and health care. It will lead you to dive deeper. Sadly, not much has been written about the alternative theory, but I recommend \"Béchamp or Pasteur?\" by E. Hume as the next book for those willing to dive deeper.

These two things go together. Maybe we have mostly harmless viruses and bacteria or even beneficial which interact with a terrain and then turn pathogenic. But however it works, it IS a real thing, contrary to the authors' assertions.The authors use examples like where they took people who were ill and tried to infect healthy people and couldn't do it. These tests were performed during the 1918 flu pandemic, which very likely wasn't an actual \"flu\" but instead of toxicity from mass vaccinations all over the world. Greece is one of the few countries who didn't accept the unused vaccines from the war period and remained uneffected.So there is a flaw in the tests. If you try to infect someone with something that isn't infectious, you definitely won't succeed. (And you may not if they are TRULY healthy and their immune system fights it off), but if all your studies revolve around things that actually are NOT infectious then you haven't actually proven that \"infectious diseases don't exist\", you've proven instead that the disease you tested that way was not infectious.There are serious questions about SARS, AIDS, 1918 \"flu\" pandemic, Polio.And then there are those we know like Scurvy and Pellegra... illnesses all thought to be infectious but which were either proven for sure not to be, or which are under serious scrutiny by some.But that does NOT mean \"no infectious illnesses exist.\" Here is an example... and we're going to utilize occam's razor... One year around the holidays, two of the children in our family came down with a stomach bug. The next day all the rest of the family had it. Nobody ate the same foods so there was no food poisoning. By what rational logic could you ever say there wasn't an actual transmissible illness involved? The bizarre contortionist conspiracy theories one has to go into to explain my family all coming down with the stomach bug in order to avoid saying it is infectious simply isn't credible.While I don't truly believe any virus has been properly purified and proven to exclusively cause some specific illness, this doesn't mean there are no communicable illness. This is just bad science and it's laughably stupid like flat earth theory. So you end up looking like an idiot and calling all your other theories into question. There is a lot of truth in your book, but saying something this ridiculous and extreme will cause most rational people to ignore everything you say.It is very reasonable to say that MANY things we believe to be communicable illnesses may have other causes. It's also very reasonable to say that a germ ALONE cannot cause an illness. (i.e. both germ and bad terrain being necessary.) It's also reasonable to say that a set of symptoms which may often show up in communicable illnesses can also show up without them. like many colds... people often get them when they are \"run down\" and they couldn't tell you who infected them. So maybe nobody.But it is NOT reasonable to conclude that there is no such thing as infectious disease when we ALL have experiences where occam's razor DEMANDS we accept that SOMETHING was going around.I also saw an interview where these two authors made the false assertion that lightning strikes from the ground up into the clouds and not the other way around and that it's an illusion. Ironically they used this \"not everything you think you see is what you really see\" analogy to propose germ theory not being real.But the TRUTH about lightening is that SOMETIMES it strikes from the ground up, but often/most of the time it strikes from the clouds. It goes BOTH ways, which... hey... as analogies go, goes with my view that germ theory AND terrain theory work/go together and just because you find that SOMEinfectious diseases are scams, doesn't mean they all are.i.e. the strawman of taking the most obvious examples and then extrapolating that out onto things that are much less easy to dismiss like my family stomach bug example.And EVERYONE has had this experience. I've also seen a bunch of mothers who used to catch every stomach bug their kid brought home until they developed a strict sickness protocol.Also quarantines WORK in actual infectious diseases. If the illnesses weren't transmissible, quarantine wouldn't stop them.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R2FNVN16BOTR1U","asin":{"original":"B082ZPVLZ5","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2020","date":{"date":"April 16, 2020","unix":1586995200},"name":"Samantha","rating":5,"title":"Great Book","review":"Great Book Crrow777 listener here!!!","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RI0ZYAIYU541W","asin":{"original":"B082ZPVLZ5","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2020","date":{"date":"April 15, 2020","unix":1586908800},"name":"Marlene Murphy","rating":5,"title":"Read this if you value your health & freedoms!","review":"It's dense material, but the author's do a fantastic job of explaining what really makes us sick and the huge holes in germ theory.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R758BJM9A85J9","asin":{"original":"B082ZPVLZ5","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2020","date":{"date":"April 12, 2020","unix":1586649600},"name":"Mel","rating":5,"title":"History repeating itself!","review":"I am blown away!This flys in the face of conventional medicine!This can describe our current “pandemic” with “Covid-19”.We see history repeating itself right before our eyes.Read this book and be informed!","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1HVGRHCRPAGRQ","asin":{"original":"B082ZPVLZ5","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2020","date":{"date":"April 8, 2020","unix":1586304000},"name":"ColJean","rating":5,"title":"Take your Power over your body back!","review":"So much misinformation in the medical community has led people to believe they need to rely on medicine to survive when in fact our bodies are so much more intelligent than we believe.

It was a question I had been bouncing around for some time after news of the CV pandemic started streaming in. Information I had gathered in the past was surfacing, and I couldn’t ignore the feeling that things were not adding up.Then, after a rudimentary web search, I found that other people had spent a great deal of time in endeavours to answer this question. The results were overwhelming. I would have to spend months, it seemed, digging through all of them before I got even a basic understanding of the material. However, since the question I asked was so similar to the one posed by the authors, I took a gamble on their book. A gamble which turned out to pay off, in a big way.When I looked at the cover for the first time, it evoked in me a deep, visceral, emotional response. Without much proof, it is hard to process, and easy to reject, especially if you’ve spent your whole life believing otherwise. I’m sure most people say the same before they dig into the material, but if you have an open mind — and a desire to learn — you may find yourself reconsidering a few things. Unfortunately, the people most likely to reject the message of this book are those who have a stake in keeping it under wraps.“It is difficult to make a man understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” — Upton SinclairThe scientific method, and the processes of truth, logic and reason it embodies, is the highest pursuit anyone can strive for in their life. It takes time and effort. You hit a lot of dead ends. People will try to stop you. It takes you to dark places, and it makes you want to give up and forget everything. As John Lennon once said, “Living is easy with eyes closed.” Ultimately, however, what makes it all worth it is a greater understanding of the universe, one’s place within it, and the chance to change the world for the better.Unfortunately, all too often, the fruits of such altruistic labours are intentionally buried underneath other ideas that do not rock the boat of vested interests as much — ideas that give more power to those that do not deserve it, instead of benefiting humanity as a whole. The discoveries made by Nikola Tesla, Raymond Rife, and all the other scientists whose supposedly dangerous ideas were rejected, are not well-known because of this. However, they are still around, and, like the proverbial snowball rolling down the hill, they continue to gain wider support with each passing day.“A lie doesn't become truth, wrong doesn't become right, and evil doesn't become good, just because it's accepted by a majority.” – Booker T. WashingtonYou don’t need to be a doctor to understand this book. You don’t even need a university education. All you need is time, patience and open eyes. But don’t just take my word for it.

I get why it wasn't published when written: dark, depressing, and over-the-top. May has certainly honed his craft since the 1990's. I also get why he was able to bring this book out this year; May has honed his craft to the extent that any \"new\" book by him is bound to be considered. Also, the pandemic topic is, shall we say, extremely timely just now. But this book should have stayed in the bottom drawer, or, at the very least, been re-written substantially. I was so angry when I read the last lines, I might have thrown the book across the room, except that I was reading it on my iPad Kindle. Suffice it to say, May should leave the doom and gloom to Cormack McCarthy or Peter Heller, either of whom at least writes prose so poetic as to make the descent into Hades worth attending. I would have given Lockdown zero stars, but one star appears to be the minimum. If you love Peter May, don't read this book!

The book was written in six weeks and the author spent many sleepless nights in order to finish it. The publishers thought that the plot was far-fetched and unrealistic while they refused to discuss possible developments regarding the fate of the novel. Lockdown was archived in a dropbox file and May continued his splendid writing career almost forgetting that it ever happened. Fifteen years later, the Covid-19 pandemic is ravaging the world, leaving behind dead bodies and a world in a state of emergency, unable to deal with the ever-growing needs of the people who are plagued with the virus. Thus, it was time for Lockdown to be published as the scenario of a worldwide spreading of a deadly disease was no longer unthinkable. Apart from the novel's prescience, there are more merits to it as a big city in lockdown provides the most suitable setting for a disturbing story to unfold.It all begins when the workers at a construction site find a leather bag containing human remains in a trench as they are building a new hospital in order to cope with the demands of the era. The human bones they discover belong to a little kid, a girl of Chinese extraction who was murdered elsewhere and whose body was thrown away by the culprit(s) so they could be certain that it would never be found. D.I. Jack MacNeil is an old-school, hard-boiled cop from the Scottish Highlands and he is immediately drawn to the case, he almost becomes obsessed with the hunt for the girl's murderer as the plot evolves. MacNeil is divorced and has a little son, an eight-year-old boy who gets afflicted with the flu and his life is in danger. All the above occur in the course of one day, which is also the last day on the job for MacNeil. The challenges that he will have to face during that twenty fours will prove to be overwhelming, nevertheless, the detective will have to overcome all the hardships and uncover a huge conspiracy, connected with the deadly pandemic.May is a skilled writer and his descriptions of a city in lockdown are vivid and captivating as well as terribly relevant to the situation that we are experiencing today. Of course, the Scottish author outlines a much more horrid reality than that we are living in with a virus that kills 60% or 70% of those who get afflicted. May did extended research on the bird flu and that makes the story all the more terrifying as Lockdown depicts an alternate reality, a much more difficult one, that reminds us that things could always be worse. Except for the quarantine, every night in London a series of vandalism and mass looting take place while in the streets of the capital armed soldiers control the traffic and have orders to shoot whoever doesn't have the special permission that is required to leave your house and get outside. Many residences and shops that thrived in the past are shut down and nothing remains to reflect London's history as one of the most significant Western capitals in the whole world.The story itself is less important than the setting of the novel, nevertheless, that doesn't mean that Lockdown's plot is lacking any spirit. We are witnessing the cooperation between the distraught Inspector MacNeil and the forensics specialist, Amy, a disabled young woman who is in love with Jack, that moves the investigation forward. The pacing is even and as the plot escalates, the tempo gets quicker until the final climax which is revelatory and satisfying, leaving no open questions to the reader. This is a book that is recommended to everybody for obvious reasons, even those who are not so keen on crime fiction. The title itself is the best advertisement for the novel that feels like it has been written today and not in 2005. Peter May is one of the most brilliant representatives of the Scottish Tartan noir tradition and his work should never be overlooked as it happened fifteen years earlier by some short-sighted publishers.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1PF3YNYPE2SJI","asin":{"original":"1529411696","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2020","date":{"date":"December 16, 2020","unix":1608080400},"name":"George Drummond","rating":5,"title":"Superb and funny.","review":"Logan Macrae is back!!!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1TZT1PPUVQAY6","asin":{"original":"1529411696","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2020","date":{"date":"November 29, 2020","unix":1606611600},"name":"Irene","rating":4,"title":"Good s","review":"Good story line.

The writing was by a British author and the prose in Queen’s English, so it was a bit different from the usual American authors I read. However, I’ve always had an affection for stories set in Jolly Olde’ Englande’. The atmosphere resonates with me.The writing was mostly outstanding with solid third-person, past-tense. It was mostly limited, however the author would occasionally head-hop, which is a pet peeve of mine. It wasn’t enough to jerk me out of the story, but enough to give me pause on occasion.The narrative was brisk with mostly short chapters and scenes and it never bogged down with exposition.The thing that struck me a little odd was the rather abrupt ending. While it was satisfying, it certainly didn’t elaborate. I’ll leave it at that.Overall, I had a great time and was able to close the book with a big smile on my face.

It's all kinds of crazy. Crazy in crazy. And crazy in how uncanny it is.A little backstory here... The author wrote this book over 15 years ago and never published it. For whatever reason, it was released this month. In the middle of a worldwide pandemic. In the middle of half of the world being in a stay at home order and wearing masks. Why is this so important?...This isn't something I usually do, but I am going to lightly set the book up for you...There's a killer flu. Like a super killer flu. The death rate is around 50%. London isn't in a stay at home order, but a military lockdown. No one is allowed to travel through the city without permission. People have literally locked themselves in their homes. Not one business is open. Looters have ravaged the city. And cue in a child killer...I still don't know if it was a smart idea to read this book right now, but nonetheless, I did. I think the scariest part of the book is the thought of what could be if governments decided to hold too much power over us in our current times. This idea really had my blood pumping and heart racing.This book is so well-written, I couldn't stop thinking about it. It's full of twists and excitement that had me turning the pages. I had connected some dots, but the real mystery was revealed early. Some might balk at that, but it was for a reason. Everything that happened after that was like a racing countdown. The hunt was on.I highly recommend this book for all the thriller and suspense readers. However, depending on where your head is right now, I might hold off.

Being in the middle of a global pandemic seems as good a time as any to read it. The author's note at the start explains that the book was written in 2005 but rejected by his publishers as being implausible. 2020 has changed perceptions though and a plot focused around a locked down London seems very normal (how times have changed....). Respect is due to Peter May for revisiting the novel and his publishers presumably could see the commercial potential.Just short of 400 pages, this novel has 27 chapters, all of which are subdivided into 3, 4 or 5 parts (not sure why?)It starts as a fascinating read. The book really shows how bad Covid could be if it's mortality rate were higher - the virus in the book has a rate of nearly 80% so is a very different prospect to Covid19 but is interesting to think about.Some of the practical steps taken by the government in the book would have been unthinkable just a year ago but so much of this book has already happened that it has lost much of it's shock value - schools closed, hospitals on red alert, emergency hospitals being built, churchs closed, and many other things.I was very uncomfortable about the author's handling of sexuality, disability and racism. Whilst he tackles all these areas, I was left with the feeling that he was fulfilling an obligation to include areas of prejudice rather than the issue being a natural part of the plot. It's worth remembering that the story was written 15 years ago but that really isn't any excuse for clumsiness.Technology has also moved on and what would have felt very modern in 2005 in standard now. In fact, technology and science have really stepped up and are both being used in the fight against the virus.After a good start the plot goes downhill and it is disappointing how muddled it gets with far too many inconsistencies. Regardless of the 15 years passing and the current experiences, this is still not a credible story.London is a huge character in the book and seemed to overpower the people. We are continually told where the detective is as he drives around the city trying the solve the crime. I didn't need to know every route that he takes although the author tells us whenever MacNeil goes anywhere.As the book goes on I started to pull the plot apart which gets easier as more unlikely things happen. The final third was simply preposterous - I hung on until the end but it felt like I was reading the script to a very bad action movie (everything after the car crash was just ridiculous).I came to the conclusion that the publishers had taken the original script and published it quickly without any time taken to edit it at all. There was a great idea in this book but the execution was not good.The biggest positive about the book is that Peter May donated his advance to charity so I don't feel that buying the book was a waste of money - it's a shame that it wasn't better.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RX88WECSDV40J","asin":{"original":"1529411696","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 29, 2020","date":{"date":"December 29, 2020","unix":1609203600},"name":"tina","title":"Worth a read","review":"It was a Christmas present for someone it's a ok read they said","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R390SUA5QHYSEE","asin":{"original":"1529411696","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 26, 2020","date":{"date":"December 26, 2020","unix":1608944400},"name":"Paul Mastaglio","title":"This virus could be murder!","review":"Thought provoking tale.

He goes into depth about legal rights and freedoms, describing the steps and including paperwork that can potentially assist a person to challenge mandatory/forced vaccination.The book corroborates part of Dr. Hamer's discoveries (German New Medicine), specifically the 4th biological law: the beneficial role of microbes, how viruses and bacteria are not the bad guy but rather beneficial organisms we're dependent on who serve us during the healing phase as garbage collectors and clean up crew of tissue/debris from illness, toxins, poor diet/personal habits, tumor breakdown, etc. just as rats etc. show up/clean up at a garbage dump.Rats don't create the garbage anymore than viruses or bacteria create disease but both can be found nonetheless with \"bad germs\" labeled as the cause of infectious illness by mainstream medicine. As doctors, vets, researchers now know, many microbes such as staph, salmonella, etc. are present in healthy people or animals without symptoms or illness, including HIV.Thanks to books like \"Good-bye Germ Theory\" those open minded enough to acknowledge inconsistencies and investigate popular medical dogma soon discover that besides his well known plagiarism and falsifications Pasteur's germ theory proves counter-intuitive with too many exceptions and casual relationships (erroneously labeled as causes) that simply do not equal fundamental biological laws of nature like the predictable, verifiable discoveries of GNM ([...])The book is worded strongly at times, which is understandable given the undeniable harm done by vaccines (and many other medical interventions) to this day, including to my precious grandchild and myself.

Popper is hardly qualified to really weigh in on these types of subjects. She is a nutritionist and a naturopath and NOT a real doctor. Nor does she have any degrees in Chemistry or Virology. Beyond the obvious reasons to be skeptical of her work (NO credentials or experience with subject) she makes some very outlandish claims regarding Viruses in general and vaccines. The problem here is that she is so far outside of the Consensus of Scientific Opinion that we must require her to bring overwhelming evidence. Carl Sagan said it right long ago: The Sagan standard is a neologism abbreviating the aphorism that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" (ECREE). If I propose that the world is flat, then the burden of proof is on me to bring extraordinary proof of this claim, since the claim is itself extraordinary (Way outside the consensus of scientific opinion in the field of Astronomy). Again, Popper in this book is Way outside of the consensus of scientific opinion in Epidemiology and Virology and offers NO strong or extraordinary evidence to support her wild claims. So, one must wonder if she and her co author are just not that bright, or are they clever charlatans taking advantage of this time in our history where so many people are overly skeptical of good science and not skeptical enough of the pseudo-science.

The scientists she disparages have no hidden agenda. They are highly trained scientists with advanced degrees from our best universities who have devoted their lives to helping people. With a quarter of a million people dead and that number likely to double very soon, please follow simple guidelines of distancing and masking and hand washing. Sadly because these measures were disparaged in lies told by top government officials and people like Ms. Popper, we now face more shut downs and further damage to the economy. If theeconomy is your top concern then please follow the guidelines. Even if your top worries are mental health and freedom, please understand that the fastest way to recover these is to get the virus under control. People are dying because they can’t get an ICU bed for brain and heart and cancer operations - they are all full of covid patients. Please listen to the Osterholm Update weekly podcast for an actual epidemiology expert on this pandemic. Ms. Popper is a naturopathic doctor with no training or expertise in infectious disease or epidemiology. She specializes in nutrition to prevent and reverse disease. For the like of me I can’t understand what her notice is here. Many have lost parents, spouses and yes children. Young people with no risk factors have died and had strokes. People have ongoing serious illness after contracting this virus- even if it doesn’t kill them. Wearing a high quality two layer mask, washing hands and physically distancing is a cheap way to save lives and our economy. One only need look at the countries who have successfully controlled the virus and are now fully open with mask wearing such as Taiwan. In a country of 23 million people only 7 have died. They immediately got every single person to wear a mask all the time. Be smart. Get other sources of information. Save yourself and your family. Our country is by far the worst in deaths per thousand people from covid. It is because we have not followed masking, distancing, testing and contact tracing. Let’s get the virus under control before we have a million dead. The virus is NOT a hoax. The hoax is the false conspiracy theories.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3VO2DNVMERJRH","asin":{"original":"1633374432","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2020","date":{"date":"November 15, 2020","unix":1605402000},"name":"Jackie King","rating":1,"title":"Amazing","review":"Such an eye opening book about this “planned demic”.

I am not much the believer in germ theory and COVID-19 has done nothing to change my opinion on that. This is perhaps my only divergence of viewpoint from Dr. Popper's book and not enough of a divergence to worry about as our synopsis ends up the same. I joked early into the Plandemic that I was immune because I do not own a television, but as two weeks turned into two months turned into six months I realized it was more accurate than about any other explanation. Everyone hates being fooled, so it is therefore easier to fool someone than to convince them that they have been fooled, I get that.

Zorach","rating":1,"title":"Rosa Koire is Lady Karen Supreme, Summoner of Managers","review":"Abject. To be completely honest, I only made it about a third of the way through this book-- because it was just that bad. Rosa Koire, a commercial real estate appraiser who runs what she calls the \"Post Sustainability Institute,\" delivers a rambling, unresearched polemic that hopelessly misconstrues, misinterprets, misappropriates, imagining bogeymen where there are none.Koire seems to think that bicycle safety advocates amount to \"shock troops\" in a global conspiracy that will forcibly demolish entire cities to build bike lanes and bus stops. She misunderstands the goals of sustainable city planning (I'm a city planner with an MBA and am vaguely qualified to talk about this) as being tantamount to central planning rather than firmly entrenched in market logic. She spends an entire section, for example, talking about how horrible it was that her local city government installed bike lanes on a street in her neighborhood. The example is not only completely irrelevant, disconnected from any concept of \"UN Agenda 21,\" and completely divorced from any understanding of street planning and traffic safety.Interestingly, Koire, for all her ostensible love of liberal market economy, doesn't understand it one bit. One example: She cites agricultural conservation programs as an example of government overreached aimed at intentionally destabilizing the food supply and destroying family farms. In reality, conservation programs prevent erosion that might otherwise deplete vitally important productive land, and these programs often end up driving up commodity prices indirectly, supporting smaller farmers.Throughout the book, Koire's obsession with the idea of \"manufacturing consensus\" seems to almost refer to the likes of Naomi Klein, who coined the term \"Shock Doctrine\" in the 2008 book of the same name. Klein believes in consensus-based, collaborative exchanges that allow human beings to make mutually beneficial decisions; Klein is not a fan of corporate control based on lies and liberalization of economy at the expense of the poor and for the benefit of the super-rich. This is as much an argument in favor of the individual liberty Koire ostensibly so covets! However, if Koire is going for the Noam Chomsky connection, I think she has missed the point, because she clearly misconstrues how power relations actually work. The War on Terror is not, as she claims, a \"Communitarian\" plot to try and impart control unto everyone's lives. Rather, it was a foolish, misguided effort based on lies, propped up by corporate interests that ended up deriving from it hundreds of billions-- if not, indeed, trillions- in profits. She hopelessly misunderstands Hegel, Marx, and modern development theories and critique. She mentions the Delphi method is mentioned 31 times and is obsessed with what she views as its use in implementing oppressive, Communitarian structures. The Delphi method isn't mind control, bro-- it's essentially just a way to run meetings, forecast outcomes, and assemble information.If you want a good critique of globalization and corporate capitalism, look at a book like David Korten's When Corporations Rule The World, or Naomi Klein's This Changes Everything. Spare yourself the excruciating pain of this poorly-written, rambling, substance-free polemic.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1U8C7SD5SGVEK","asin":{"original":"0615494544","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2020","date":{"date":"July 19, 2020","unix":1595116800},"name":"skip","rating":5,"title":"Very sad for US.","review":"Sadly an amazing read.

The book tells their story BUT does not end there.The author goes on to detail about how property owners can recognize whether the UN Agenda 21 has infiltrated their town or city and what they need to know to even begin to protect themselves from being victimized by an insidious group of people who will push this agenda on them, especially if they do not recognize what tell tale signs to look for.Rosa Koire, lifts the mask, so the reader can recognize all that is claiming to be done as a \"green\" or \"sustainable\" project may very likely warrant a second look. Do not be naive but rather be cautioned to proactively delve deeper into all projects coming to your vicinity, and do so long before property owners find they either gave their property rights away or are about to have them stolen away without even knowing they were up for grabs.The UN Agenda 21 has stealthily been gaining ground for far too many years. It has had time to dig itself into most communities, all the while managing to look innocent and trustworthy and possibly already been given the green light or key to your property.This book explains how it was given its foothold, and shows how to spot its tracks, and how to get involved with running this destructive menance off.WARNING: IT MAY NOT BE AS EASY, AS YOU MAY WANT TO THINK, TO RID YOURSELF AND YOUR NEIGHBORS OF UN AGENDA 21'S PLANS TO TAKE OVER, WHATEVER IT DEEMS DESIRABLE, BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, YES, WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL, YET NOT KNOWING WHAT THE ENEMY, IN SHEEPS CLOTHING, IS, THAT YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF UP AGAINST, SOONER OR LATER, AND/OR BEING PASSIVE, WILL NOT BE YOUR SOLUTION.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1WO1F3IMYWZF7","asin":{"original":"0615494544","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020","date":{"date":"May 29, 2020","unix":1590710400},"name":"Dez Fran","rating":5,"title":"WOW a must read","review":"Clearly explains so much ofwhat I have personally seen but didn't have the answer to what was going on.Read before it's too late.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2486XHX0LYWDE","asin":{"original":"0615494544","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2020","date":{"date":"May 15, 2020","unix":1589500800},"name":"Joy Mooney","rating":4,"title":"Great read, had some parts that dragged","review":"Pretty enlightening and good book overall, but I wasn't a fan of the second half as much.

I lived in San Francisco for 22 years and was involved in City Hall politics as a gay man and Libertarian activist, and everything this author says about pay-to-play and cronyism in local government in her own City of Santa Rosa under a \"green mask\" (my term is \"fauxgressive\") is true. I've seen it myself. Until I read this book, I didn't have a name for what I observed and witnessed such as the concept of \"being Delphied.\"Don't be fooled that this book is a whole bunch of glittering generalities about a far away and out-of-touch UN - the Author talks about her very specific and local experience with how the globalism ideology trickles down and often buys out and dupes powerful constituencies to perpetuate a racket that is anything but progressive. I witnessed this firsthand with Redevelopment in San Francisco motivated by nice-sounding ideologies such as New Urbanism or Climate-Change, but it has a very very very dark undercurrent (especially in regard to civil liberties) that negate the stated vision. Such shills are the masters of their own enslavement.Americans, especially, should read this book because we still have the State and Local institutions where individuals can thwart the Agenda. The author is a model of civic engagement and fortitude, and unlike most books on 'conspiracies' or 'globalism' I read this one feeling empowered rather than defeated.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2COHZY7VQOSBX","asin":{"original":"0615494544","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2020","date":{"date":"November 11, 2020","unix":1605056400},"name":"Dr T Rex","rating":5,"title":"UN agenda gets put in place without your knowledge","review":"A must read for Globalists","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1YEHHIB7PEGYF","asin":{"original":"0615494544","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2020","date":{"date":"October 27, 2020","unix":1603760400},"name":"Akinmt","rating":5,"title":"Time is running out to stop this conspiracy!","review":"A VERY important and timely book about what is happening around the world by those who seek to control the world by imposing one government control.

It gives a brilliant insight into the creeping effects of UN Agenda 21/30 and how Governments seem to be utterly surrendering, to the dictates inherent within that undemocratic and shadowy document. Rosa takes readers through her sustained battles in her locality of Samosa County, California, in efforts to try and defend citizens rights and some private property against the real agenda behind the \"Green Mask\" i.e. UN Agenda 21/30. The book is an inspiration for communities anywhere, who wish to stand up and be counted, in push back against tyrannical and shadowy institutions, which seem to be springing up everywhere based upon the real agenda i.e. Agenda 21/30. A major component of UN Agenda 21/30 is depopulation. Wake up people! A strange monument appeared in Georgia around the time of publication of UN Agenda 21/30 known as the Georgia Guide Stones. Do your research, and note what the first objective is on those stones. It is an eye opener. Lastly I might mention the recent so-called, but very, very strange wild fires, in Santa Rosa, California. Could there be any connection between what looks like deliberately caused fires of the most incredibly incinerating heat, and UN Agenda 21/30? Just asking.

What's that?","review":"This book was... interesting to say the least. It made some good points and I could see where the author was coming from. As an environmentalist it pissed me off to read about \"environmental policy\" being used to control populations, and I recognize that governments are mostly shady and will use any issue to further their agendas. There is a huge level of corruption in every government around the world.The thing that really (and I mean REALLY) peeved me was the fact that you will not find a single citation throughout the whole book. Sure, you'll find the occasional useless quote or the rare graph, but none of these are cited! Even if the author shows you a graph and says they found it online, they need to tell you WHERE they found it online, who the creator/author is, and give you the means to find it. There are many times they simply assert things and state them as fact but give no citation as to where they got their information. You're going to talk about the Delphi technique? What are you using as YOUR foundation of knowledge on the subject? Where can I find those foundational pieces to learn more? Oh... wait. I can't.This book can be rhetorically ripped to shreds just based on the lack of citations. Then there's the pathetic appeals: the doomsday tone, the slippery slope assumptions about what could happen if we allow (x) to happen, etc. The author is a good writer, don't get me wrong, but they aren't good at crafting a rhetorically sound argument.Also it's interesting to note that the author never brushes on the tragedy of the commons and how not allowing people to own private property would most likely cause high-density living areas to become incredibly dirty and disgusting. And this is just a personal peeve, but the sans serif font gave me a headache. Any block of text that is more than a headline should be in a serif font - this is a writing convention.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3C5SD2ZWNDRVD","asin":{"original":"0615494544","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2017","date":{"date":"June 9, 2017","unix":1496966400},"name":"Jocelyn E.

In addition, Niki documented Communitarian Law (see http://nord.twu.net/acl/research/commlaw.html ), while Rosa completely ignored the binding international laws that originated out of Brussels. Without knowledge of the laws that allow UN Agenda 21 to thrive, how can they be addressed and reversed?If people take action that will have any lasting impact, they will be required to engage UN Agenda 21 on the legal front. Not including information on Communitarian Law misdirects the energy of the activist, and helps ensure that energy is ineffectively used by attacking the symptoms of UN Agenda 21, and not the cause. It helps ensure UN Agenda 21's laws are never challenged or modified. Adding an additional section of the laws would have been easy for Koire to do. Why did she not include the heart of the topic matter in her book?Some other must-reads: George Dillon - Grand Orient Freemasonry Unmasked (1885), Niki Raapana - 2020 Our Common Destiny, Jacques Ellul - Propaganda The Formation of Mens Attitudes, The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations - John Coleman, and The Permanent Instruction of the Alta Vendita.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R38C2HSPRWFFRE","asin":{"original":"0615494544","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2015","date":{"date":"August 16, 2015","unix":1439683200},"name":"FrankieR","rating":5,"title":"Five Stars","review":"A must read.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1NUM3MI9IV1V4","asin":{"original":"0615494544","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2015","date":{"date":"August 11, 2015","unix":1439251200},"name":"B.

WE, as a global community need to be better stewards of Earth if we want anything to pass on to our grandkids. Don't misunderstand me, there is heavy truth to the fact that government agencies are running amok (EPA!)and going overboard with their policies. They have been given a blank check to do what ever they please and that needs to stop. I have read Agenda 21 multiple times cover to cover for my studies. Rosa Kiore is very passionate and it is evident in this book. However, passion does not equal facts. If you read this book looking for some heartfelt stories then you will be satisfied. But, every time she directed me to go to some page to find what she was talking about, it wasn't there.

The globalists want us living in \"Transit Villages\" where everything a community needs will be contained in 100 square miles. It will be extremely prohibitive to go from one T.V .to another so as to keep people contained and controlled. This so called \"Smart Development\" is happening all over. If you've ever wondered how George Orwells society came about, this is a possible blueprint for it to happen.

What does it mean to play \"dominos on cheese\"? Why would someone \"get pizza for an hour\"?These are the questions, derived from odd and incongruous statements found in the leaked emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, that led to the phenomenon known as Pizzagate. In an attempt to answer these questions, internet researchers posited that the strange usages of \"cheese\", \"pizza\", and other words could be related to \"cheese pizza\", a long-known (and acknowledged by law enforcement) internet code word for child pornography. Following this line of investigation, researchers were led to James Alefantis, owner of D.C. pizzeria Comet Ping Pong, and other Podesta associates, many of whom had posted very disturbing and inappropriate images of, or comments relating to children on various social media websites. The establishment media, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, the BBC, and many others quickly derided and dismissed Pizzagate as \"fake news\", but in reality, the above mentioned facts are neither \"fake\" nor \"news\" at all.This book is essentially a compilation of articles from the author's own blog, in which he chronicled the findings of, and media reaction to, Pizzagate research as it came into the public view. It is intelligently written and avoids wild speculation - it presents the basics of the evidence for Pizzagate and allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. It refutes the claims made by the media against Pizzagate and its proponents and researchers.There is actually much more evidence relating to Pizzagate in existence than what is included in the book. The book would have to be perhaps ten times longer to report on everything that has surfaced since the inception of the investigation, but the fundamentals are here, and anyone new to the subject, or who only knows of it through the media's distorted and inaccurate presentation of it, ought to have a firm grasp on what Pizzagate is and is not after reading this book.","verified_purchase":true}],"asin":"1086050320"},{"total_reviews":313,"stars_stat":{"1":"4%","2":"4%","3":"8%","4":"12%","5":"72%"},"result":[{"id":"RFNJBSHA6O0TJ","asin":{"original":"1291419438","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020","date":{"date":"April 29, 2020","unix":1588118400},"name":"Atom","rating":5,"title":"MUST READ!","review":"If you are wondering WTF is going on in this world right now....this will shed some light on it.

Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is. They could only be dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked upon as a matter of indifference. They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect.\"-George Orwell, 1984\"The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves.\"-Vladimir Ilich Lenin\"The Falsification of History\" by John Hamer is a very well done piece of controlled opposition propaganda. It smoothly blends extraordinary lies with extraordinary truths and then, of course, fails to support either with sufficient evidence to convince a true sceptic. The book seems designed to drive the average curious truthseeker away, while simultaneously hoping to infect \"Truthers\" with cleverly constructed disinformation. The logical fallacies that readily come to mind are \"poisoning the well\" and \"the straw man argument\". Hamer deliberately creates \"straw men\" that the sceptic will easily tear down and, simultaneously feeds \"poisoned\" information to the truth movement (i.e. he creates a poisoned well from which he hopes \"Truthers\" will drink and sceptics will not). Here are a few interesting quotes from the book:\"This 'cabal' of evil is best known as the 'illuminati' and includes a core of thirteen bloodlines, all interconnected, intermarried and tracing their lineage back to the Near East in ancient times. They are worshippers of 'Lucifer' and see themselves as 'Gods' on a planet filled with 'cattle'. (Page 24)\"Many historical records and other esoteric sources strongly indicate that ETs genetically engineered modern humans and instigated the rise of civilization. Both positively-oriented and negatively-oriented ETs that have largely been in control of the earth for the past several thousand years via their direct descendants, the elite, illuminati, thirteen bloodline families.\" (Page 66)\"In the 1930s, Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss of Austria conducted an investigation into Hitler's heritage, the result of which was a document that proved that Maria Ann Schicklgruber, Johann's wife and Hitler's grandmother was in fact living away from the family home in Spital at the time of her conception of Alois. She was employed as a live-in servant at the home of Baron Rothschild in Vienna and as soon as her pregnancy became known to the Rothschilds she was immediately, conveniently dispatched back home to her husband in Spital, where Alois was eventually born.If all this is true (and Dollfuss and many other researchers certainly believe it to be so) then this means that Hitler was not only one quarter Jewish, but also the grandson of a Rothschild. The significance of this fact should not be underestimated .\"(Page 255)\"As I say, the fact that Hitler was a Rothschild is far from insignificant.\"(also page 255)\"Some researchers report that he (Hitler) had spent some time as a gay prostitute before WWI after leaving his home when his mother died and also reputedly had some distinctly aberrant relationships with women, being a capraphile, the scientific name for someone who derives sexual pleasure from human excrement and the excretory act itself.\" (Page 258)Please allow me to offer you the following information that I hope will be of some assistance to you in your pursuit of the truth.\"Logic, therefore, as the science of thought, or the science of the process of pure reason, should be capable of being constructed a priori.\"-Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Controversy (\"a priori\" is defined as deduced from self-evident premises)\"Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.\"-George Orwell, 1984Formal/Classical Logic was invented by Aristotle in ancient Greece (circa 350 B.C.). It is a remarkably versatile and effective system of \"rules for reasoning\" that anyone can use to good effect. Devised as a systematic method of evaluating evidence and language arguments to (1) insure correct reasoning within the limitations of the existing evidence, and (2) effectively reveal erroneous or deceptive reasoning, it was soon to govern and define the measured thought of the leading rulers and intellectuals of the ancient world. Alexander the Great was only the first of a very long line of adherents of formal logic that would dramatically alter the course of history. To this very day, utilized in virtually every field that requires accurate and objective reasoning from archaeology, astronomy and medicine, to law, politics and war, more so than any other intellectual tool, formal logic has been responsible for laying the foundations of our civilization. Curiously, formal logic contains one common historical thread that has always been true. Niether the ancient Greeks, nor the Romans, nor the old antbellum American South ever considered it wise to teach formal/classical logic to common slaves, for obvious reasons. The teaching of Classical logic was removed from the U.S. public school system over 150 years ago, and has been systematically suppressed by our media for exactly the same reasons (\"The Underground History of American Education\" by John Gatto, his \"Ultimate History Lesson\" on YouTube, \"The Lost Tools of Learning\" by Dorothy Sayers, \"The Prussian School System\", and \"Operant Conditioning\", all online). If you doubt this just ask some average U.S. high school graduates sometime to tell you the difference between a \"formal\" and an \"informal\" logical fallacy; or, how to determine if an argument is both \"valid\" and \"sound\" (i.e., very basic and essential knowledge of formal logic). You'll find that they have no idea. The vast majority couldn't even tell you the difference between \"deductive\" and \"inductive\" reasoning. As you will soon see, this is no accident.The following is a concise and effective method of using formal logic and is the essence of that ancient system of reasoning (adapted from a definition given in Howard Kahane' s book \"Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric\", 1976).\"All instruction given or received by way of argument proceeds from pre-existent knowledge.\"Aristotle, Posterior Analytics\"We ought in fairness to fight our case with no help beyond the bare facts: nothing, therefore, should matter except the proof of those facts.\"-Aristotle, RhetoricCogent (logical) reasoning, reasoning designed to strongly appeal to the intellect rather than the emotions, should meet 3 conditions:1. It must be derived from premises that \"you know\" are true. (These are true propositions that are either; (a) \"self-evident\"; (b) verified by your own personal direct experience; or (c) well supported by solid verifiable evidence. There is no fourth way to \"know\" that a premise is true.).2. It should contain all of the known relevant evidence. (The suppression, or improbable absence, of relevant evidence is a good indication of deception. Relevant evidence is any evidence that would tend to make an argument more likely or less likely to be true.)3. It should be properly structured, so that it comes to a conclusion which logically follows from the premises. (In the case of valid deductive arguments this conclusion would \"necessarily\" follows from the premises. In the case of very strong inductive arguments it would follow \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". In both cases it would be free of contradiction and consistent with the facts.)When an argument meets these conditions (ie. verifiably true premises, all relevant evidence, and properly structured) it is said to be sound or cogent, and very likely to be true. When an argument does not meet these conditions it is said to be fallacious (faulty/deceptive reasoning).\"Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four.\"-George Orwell, 1984\"The province of Logic must be restricted to that portion of our knowledge which consists of inferences from truths previously known; whether those antecedent data be general propositions, or particular observations and perceptions. Logic is not the science of Belief, but the science of Proof, or Evidence. In so far as belief professes to be founded on proof, the office of Logic is to supply a test for ascertaining whether or not the belief is well grounded.\"- John Stuart Mill, A System of Logic\"Aristotle devides all conclusions into logical and dialectical, in the manner described, and then into eristical. (3) Eristic is the method by which the form of the conclusion is correct, but the premises, the material from which it is drawn, are not true, but only appear to be true. Finally (4) sophistic is the method in which the form of the conclusion is false, although it seems correct. These three last properly belong to the art of Controversial Dialectic, as they have no objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and pay no regard to truth itself; that is to say, they aim at victory.\"-Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Controversy(Very helpful in analyzing the relationship between premises and conclusion is the following taken from the book \"Logic and Rhetoric\" [1968] by James Johnson. \"The hypothesis most likely to prove right must do the following: 1. Include all known facts; 2. Not over-emphasize any part of the evidence at the expense of the rest; 3. Observe the laws of probability as established by previous investigation; 4. Avoid logical contradictions; 5. Stay as simple as possible without ignoring any part of the evidence. Hypotheses which violate any one of these requirements are Forced Hypotheses.\")\"To know what you know, and to know what you do not know. That is true knowledge.\"-Confucius\"Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.-Former United States Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld at a press conference Febuary 12, 2002Two years later Rumsfeld offers us a \"fourth kind\" of knowledge about which people who would one day like \"free\" systems of government to actually exist should be keenly interested.\"Febuary 4th, 2004Subject: What you knowThere are known knowns.There are known unknowns.There are unknown unknowns.But there are also unkown knowns. That is to say, things that you think you know, that it turns out you did not.\"-Donald Rumsfeld, from the Errol Morris documentary \"Unkown Knowns\"Here's what Donald Rumsfeld won't say.An effective understanding of classical logic is indispensable in the identification of \"unknown knowns\". That is why it has been suppressed.\"Beware of false knowledge; it is more dangerous than ignorance.\"-George Bernard ShawNow, on to a bit of rhetoric with the informal logical fallacy:\"Rhetoric is the art of ruling the minds of men.\"-PlatoProfessor Madsen Pirie most aptly defines a logical fallacy as anything one can say or do that breaks down or subverts reason. The ancient Greeks discovered over 200 different logical fallacies. Here are some commonly used \"informal\" logical fallacies taken from the book \"The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric\" by Sister Miriam Joseph Ph.D..(In his book \"Logic For Lawyers\" Ruggero Aldisert defines the formal logical fallacy as an \"error in the logical form of an argument\" and informal logical fallacies as those that \"deal with the content and context of premises.\" When an argument meets the three conditions of cogent reasoning it does not contain any formal logical fallacies.)\"ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEMArgumentum ad hominem ( literally, an \"argument to the man\") fallacy confuses the point at issue with the people concerned. Attacks on the character and conduct of people and personal abuse or praise are substituted for reasoning on the point at issue. Argumentum ad hominem seeks to persuade by unsound ethos. In rhetoric ethos means establishing the speaker or writer as one worthy of making an argument.\"\"ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUMThe argumentum ad populum fallacy arises from substituting an appeal to the passions and prejudices of the people for logical reasoning on the point at issue...\"\"ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAMThe argumentum ad misericordiam (literally, an \"argument to pity\") fallacy replaces reason with a plea for sympathy.\"\"ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUMArgumentum ad baculum is the appeal to the \"big stick.\" The issue is ignored in an attempt to inspire fear of the consequences of adopting a proposed opinion or program, or of allowing a movement branded as dangerous to gain strength. The threat of social ostracism or loss of position might be used to deter a person from exposing fraud...\"\"ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIAMArgumentum ad ignorantiam is the use of an argument that sounds convincing to others because they are ignorant of the weaknesses of the argument and of the facts that stand against it.\"ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAMArgumentum ad verecundiam is an appeal to the prestige or respect in which a proponent of an argument is held as a guarantee of the truth of the argument. This is unwarranted when reasoning about an issue is required and only the authority of its upholders or opponents is given consideration. It is perfectly legitimate to supplement reasoning with authority (Argumentum ad auctoritatem ), but it is fallacious to substitute authority for reasoning in matters capable of being understood by reason.\"SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE\"The fallacy of suppressed evidence is committed when an arguer ignores evidence that would tend to undermine the premises of an otherwise good argument, causing it to be unsound or uncogent. Suppressed evidence is a fallacy of presumption and is closely related to begging the question. As such, it's occurrence does not affect the relationship between premises and conclusion but rather the alleged truth of premises. The fallacy consists in passing off what are at best half-truths as if they were whole truths, thus making what is actually a defective argument appear to be good. The fallacy is especially common among arguers who have a vested interest in the situation to which the argument pertains.\"-Patrick Hurley, A Concise Introduction to Logic (1985)The definition of \"Poisoning the Well\" from changing minds.org\"To discredit the topic or argument, indicate how it is patently absurd, proven to be false or that only fools would support it. Discredit the other person before they speak. Or discredit the topic or argument that they may support. There are many ways of discrediting the person. Call them names. Talk about their lies. Show them to be unworthy. Tell how they are unintelligent, crazy or otherwise undesirable, inferior and not worth listening to, let alone believing.\"A very helpful tool in understanding effective rhetoric is Aristotle's three primary pillars of persuasion; (1) Ethos (authority), (2) Pathos (emotion), and (3) Logos (logic). To believe an argument that is supported by Ethos alone is to be manipulated by authority. To believe an argument that it is supported by Pathos alone is to be manipulated through emotion. Aristotle advises rather, that we take great pains to avoid being manipulated, and allow ourselves to be only truly persuaded by logos (i.e., logical arguments that are correctly reasoned and well supported by evidence).CONCLUSIONTherefore, when testing \"any\" argument one should ask if the three conditions of cogent reasoning have been met and if logical fallacies have been used.\"If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.\"-Rene Descartes\"We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; The real a tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.\"-Plato9/11:Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth9-11 Missing LinksDr Alan Sabrosky, former Director of Studies at the US Army War CollegeThe Holocaust:Bishop Richard WilliamsonDavid McCaldenDavid ColeMark WeberGermar RudolfErnst Zundel(...)Sylvia StolzCancer:Linus PaulingG.

The history we study in schoolis largely made up. In fact, what we call \"mainstream science\", \"mainstream history\", mainstream news\", etc. cannot really be trusted. I belong to the ten percent of the population who think we are constantly being lied to by a sinister group of powerful individuals who would like to keep their control over us unabated. I read more than the average individual, and I read anything and everything I could get my hands on. Once you start deciding that you do not want to look at certain sources, you handicap yourself. The much-maligned David Icke, but who I admire so much, wrote a book called \"The Biggest Secret\". I initially thought that would be a great book for truth seekers to start with. It is packed with information, concisely put together, but the mention of shape-shifters is too difficult for many people to accept, so John Hamer's book is better for these kind of people which I would kindly label \"conservative\"..ha..ha. If you are still donating to the American Cancer Society to fund their search for cancer cures....you must read this book. I can say a whole lot more, but I think you get my drift. The missing bibliography and footnotes somehow do not bother this reader, probably because everything this book contains is in other publications I have read and there is not much that I have not read since I read at least four hours a day....just to make sure I do not miss anything (including the lies of the negative cabal). It is difficult to convince people to look at information from alternative sources when they have the highly proliferated and the much manipulated mainstream news being doled out daily via the stupid box (TV) which has mesmerized many generations to stop thinking for themselves. My father worked so hard to afford the very expensive private educational institutions they sent me to where I learned, among other things, about expository writing, creating bibliographies, footnotes, etc. We did not have lessons on discernment of truths, and anything along that line. In the beginning, it took a lot of effort for me to wade through the pile high of BS we are being fed by mainstream media daily. There are actually paid dis-informants. If you read only every so often, your BS radar is not well-honed. I easily read an average of 65-70 books a year, and yet I have to exert double effort to be able to do it since English is not exactly my primary language. My love to all of you, truth-seekers. I offend a lot of my religious relatives and friends. It is not my intent. I just find it difficult to let them continue thinking the way they do. We should all be making decisions about our lives based on knowing the truths about everything. I long ago made the decision that I would rather be offensive and truthful than be beloved by appearing religious and docile, and continue to spout all the lies we have been fed for so long. There hasn't been\"Inquisitions\" for a long time, but I am amazed how their effects continue to reverberate up to today's generations. People still think they should only read materials sanctioned by the church, and other so-called authorities. We cannot arrive at the truth by allowing ourselves to be led like \"sheeples\" (contraction of sheep and people) to slaughter.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1K97BK4LFEWWG","asin":{"original":"1291419438","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2013","date":{"date":"November 18, 2013","unix":1384736400},"name":"Riley","rating":5,"title":"Very interesting and informative book!","review":"Very informative and thought provoking book.People need to be informed about what is happening around them everyday.The book takes the reader through many interesting points in history.Excellent book!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R20EFNIQEUBEQ5","asin":{"original":"1291419438","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2013","date":{"date":"October 7, 2013","unix":1381104000},"name":"Linda J.

It is OK, however, as ordinary people cannot be reached. I viewed the book as a venting process. Mr. Hamer got it all off his chest.Something we all have to consider is how a book like this gets published when the media is controlled by just a few corporations, books published by the normal process are subject to extreme censorship. It appears that Rossendale Books merely helps people self publish, so that Mr. Hamer thereby escaped the censors. This would explain absence of an index. Bibliography I don't care about, for obvious reasons. Our own brains are our best bibliographies.Then we have to answer a question that Hamer himself addresses ... are we dealing with a limited hangout? Is Hamer just another spook? He cites Dave McGowan, for example, who did a limited hangout called Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon about the LA music scene in the 60s and 70s, failing to realize that McGowan is (not \"was\") a spook. It is possible that's Hamer just missed the clues, and he gets a pass, but I expect more. So my caution flags are up.And, the biggest failing of all, Hamer either knows and does not say, or does not realize that the deaths of JFK, RFK, John Lennon, a long list of others including John Denver (which I investigated on my own), and one that he dwells on, Whitney Houston, were faked. The clues are all there with Houston, contradictory evidence, indifference of witnesses and friends, but he interprets it all as some sort of Satanic ritual about a real death, a macabre scene in which bloodthirsty villains are feasting on death. Whoosh!Taken as a whole, much good to be said. His section on education is well written, as are others on student loans, big name charities, health and nutrition. I skipped over the 9/11 section, as it is an area littered with rabbit holes. As with JFK/RFK/MLK/Malcolm X, those riddles will take decades to solve, and by the time we do, it is too late. Chemtrails/crop circles/stone monuments and all of that I don't think about, as they are riddles not worth solving, possibly even fake bread trails. I stay focused on things like TV/entertainment/sports//music, as that is where the rubber meets the road. The only way people of higher capability are ever going to be unwedged from the control system is to break them out of those thought control systems. That is where I put my effort, though I don't claim much success. I am amazed, for instance, that while TV and TV news is pervasive and hypnotic, people I discuss these things with don't watch it! Just as with Richard Nixon after his resignation, it turns out that no one actually voted for him! So too are people claiming exemption from the primary thought control mechanism. Some do confide that while they don't watch TV news, they proudly get their news by reading newspapers, a better way to stay informed. Aye, carumba!Enthralling in parts, tedious in others, clueless in yet others, all in all, you can search high and low on Amazon without finding a better book to spend some early morning hours reading.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R7RMNTEAL48KI","asin":{"original":"1291419438","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2017","date":{"date":"January 20, 2017","unix":1484874000},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":1,"title":"Uh, no...","review":"100% waste of time and money.

Without this encompassing idea, some of his claims look quite weak, particularly those concerned with present day society.Most surprisingly, the biggest lie in recent history doesn't feature, namely the Holocaust, though British and American war crimes during WW2 are covered to a certain extent.Many quotes are used from selected researchers, but when Mr Hamar simply states that there is a huge amount of evidence for some conspiracy or other, there is not the slightest attempt to support his claims, no bibliography!For those that have seen the light and now know not to believe everything you read/hear/see about events in the world, this book will provide some interesting reading. It's always up to the reader to make his/her mind up about how likely Mr Hamar's version of history and current affairs is.That's the problem with conspiracy theories, you are left to flounder about to find the truth. A few years ago I was part of the typical western mind set, man made global warming and the Holocaust I treated as articles of faith. When one learns both are untruths, despicable lies and generate witch hunts of any who wish to find the truth, then everything becomes suspect.My advice would be to pick a subject you know something about and test Mr Hamer's reliability. So far, my own results are evenly balanced. Global warming, Allied WW2 war crimes, 9/11, fake war on terrorism, 3rd world aid, I concur with Mr Hamer, he states the well known problems with these events. Anyone who's thought carefully about how the world works, will have little problem about believing those at the top have some psychopathic tendencies.For others-moon landings,aftermath of hurricanes, many aspects of current health controversies, he's on shaky ground. Unfortunately the one area where I can easily outscore Hamer in terms of experience, education, is a good example of confused logic, contradictions and plain nonsense. I really do find it amazing that he singles out Boyle's Law as an example of education for the sake of cramming useless facts into young minds. From someone who's actually had to teach Boyle's Law and associated gas law phenomena to eighteen year old students, I can honestly say it demands a pretty rigorous mental approach, and whether the students turn out to be corporate slaves or radical free thinkers, learning Boyle's Law would be viewed by both as a valuable contribution to their awareness of the physical world and their ability to process data, something Hamer espouses in other parts of his book.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R6WVTX9LF1STF","asin":{"original":"1291419438","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 23, 2015","date":{"date":"August 23, 2015","unix":1440288000},"name":"Crystyn","title":"A great book","review":"Very detailed and informative","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R36B3IBUZ2UNL0","asin":{"original":"1291419438","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 20, 2015","date":{"date":"August 20, 2015","unix":1440028800},"name":"Shezza","title":"Four Stars","review":"Very informative about the human race.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1SYZX2CDWO5XE","asin":{"original":"1291419438","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 7, 2015","date":{"date":"August 7, 2015","unix":1438905600},"name":"don robb","title":"fed up of the lies? heres the truth!!","review":"this is is a must read for every one, the truth is out,from every thing from jack the ripper to the new world order, how we have been lied to by the eliteist running the world","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RUMWX9GQ0A1DJ","asin":{"original":"1291419438","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on June 29, 2015","date":{"date":"June 29, 2015","unix":1435536000},"name":"R Christopher","title":"Check them out for yourselves,","review":"Most of the popular conspiracy theories and a few more are well covered in this book.

That the virus is primarily killing the weak is not news to me, but this got enough great reviews that I think it is news to many people. It's also possible the positive reviews have more to do with how people relate to the anger expressed by the author.It felt like when someone comes at you in an argumentative way but you're not sure why they think you're arguing with them. I really don't think I'm the intended audience. Appreciating that he feels strongly about media coverage and his own integrity doesn't change the fact that I was looking for information I didn't already have, and this didn't provide that.It reads as dishonest about what it is- an opinion piece. The author is clearly angry with media outlets about their coverage, which he feels exaggerates the danger. I don't have an opinion about that because I don't closely follow the media coverage.

First, looking at the pure numbers of deaths, it most severely and lethally affects older members of the population, especially those with underlying conditions that would probably have killed them within months anyway. (That fact should be obvious to most by now and likely contributes to the willingness of the young to up-close party, party, party without masks. If I were 20, I’d self-centeredly think the same. Approaching 72, I get that, and I see it as MY responsibility to avoid exposure to COVID until I get vaccinated. In the meantime, people are going to do whatever they please and the virus will do what it does regardless of the groveling pleading of my governor and the president-elect for mask wearing and social distancing.)The second, which logically stems from the first, is that determining the cause of death is sometimes impossibly complicated by the question: dying WITH or dying FROM? It’s a subtle but significant difference when determining COVID’s mortality rate.I suspect the following installments will be equally enlightening from Berenson’s calm and sober perspective as he examines more controversial choices to be made in the face of the disease.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R39FNOOSM3IXD7","asin":{"original":"B089P216NP","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2020","date":{"date":"December 4, 2020","unix":1607043600},"name":"B.W.","rating":5,"title":"Finally, the truth","review":"This is so important.

(Love letter to Big Gretch.)","review":"I actually read these broadsides in reverse order, and it appears that the author did not make any editorial improvements between the first and second editions.1. There are still no page numbers.2. There is no bibliography, and all of the references are embedded notes to websites. (and that's not really as bad as it sounds given that this information is changing on an hourly basis. The only place to research numbers with which a book can be written is on websites.)3. There are 25 pages with text on both sides, and then 25 blank pages?That notwithstanding, Berenson's brevity allows him to raise some extremely interesting points:1. The author does a very neat trick by actually counting the number of years of life lost - - which almost nobody thinks to do. (A 10-year-old's death is a worse tragedy than a 90-year-old's death because the former had a lot more living to do than the latter.)Of course, his calculations are dated at this point, but you can go backwards and do them again with current data from interactive sources.The median age of people worldwide killed by Covid is between 80 and 82 years old. (I think the United States average life expectancy is 78 years.)The great majority of people who died were living on borrowed time.2. It really is hard to know what is the true infection rate, because Covid-19 is frequently asymptomatic. And in that case, is very difficult to know what is the accurate death rate--or by how much it is overstated.3. Children are actually ten times more likely to die of the flu than of Covid.4. The quality of the data concerning Covid deaths reporting is *extremely* poor. It is not necessary for a patient to have a positive Covid test to be counted as a Covid death, and even (in some cases people who die of gunshot wounds are included in covid deaths) no attempts to separate out causative/precipitating/impelling factors.5. Why is nobody willing to give us an endpoint for these lockdowns? Is 40,000 deaths per annum the right number? 1,000? 0?70,000 people die from drug overdoses every year, and it just is what it is....6. Can people's immune system be primed by exposure to related coronaviruses? (That would certainly explain why there are a number of high estimates of people that are asymptomatic.)7. In the United states, big numbers are expected from a big population. But, those numbers look worse than they are when you report only the raw data.8. Who are these oracles to whom we are listening? Neil Ferguson testified before the British government, but he was/is a theoretical physicist. And he later got airbrushed out of relevance after he got caught breaking quarantine because he could not control his slappybag (=married girlfriend).9. Field hospitals were built, and dismantled for lack of use. somehow, Cuomo took it into his head that 40,000 ventilators would be needed. 10 times more than the number that was actually used. (What is an order of magnitude between friends?)Which means that the estimates were way overstated.And, we conclude what we already know... Which is that predictions are not data and models are not evidence.*******Berenson's direct questions:1. How lethal is covid-19 vis-a-vis the flu?2. Who is most at risk?3. How are covid deaths coded?4. What are the main ways in which the coronavirus is spread?5. How many people have already been infected?6. Why did the predictive models that policymakers used proved so inaccurate?7. Do lockdowns slow the spread?8. What is the evidence for and against lockdowns viewed on a public health basis?9. What are secondary harms?10. What is the mental health risk of lockdowns?11. Do mask requirements likely slow the spread?******Here are a couple of interactive trackers from well-respected public sources.1. CDC covid tracker. (Link not included because of review restrictions. No outside URLs)2. New York Times Interactive Coronavirus Map. (See earlier parenthetical insert.)The reader's digest version to answer the author's questions THAT CAN BE FOUND FROM AVAILABLE DATA are:1. The New York times shows widely varying lockdown policies, and there seems to be no consistent relationship between lockdown severity and the total number of deaths.2. The CDC numbers can be toggled to show death rates per 100,000 within the last week versus from January 21st. And there is still no consistent pattern.As of this writing, Michigan had a total of 117 deaths per 100,000 people and Ohio had just over half as much--73 per 100,000 people.(The Fat Michigan governor, Big Gretch, cost a lot of inconvenience with these lockdowns and closing this that and the other. And for what?)Utah has 38 deaths per 100,000 people, and California has 61 per 100,000 people.California was and is still locked down to death, and Utah was one of seven states that didn't even issue a stay at home order.Verdict: This was a good book at the time that it was written, but time has already given us quite a few answers.Whom is this best for?It is a 5-star book for people that are worrying themselves into an early grave about something that likely won't affect them.It is a 3 star book for people who want deeper exploration of the issues.It's a four-star book for people who want a synopsis of a lot of different current sources.Not recommended after 30 days, because the information will be too dated.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RH78B5KX75YJP","asin":{"original":"B089P216NP","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2020","date":{"date":"December 29, 2020","unix":1609203600},"name":"Kolby Schellhammer","rating":5,"title":"Eye opening","review":"I loved how the author comprehensively laid out the timeline of the fatality projections provided by our institutions on the outset - with sources - and showed how progressively mistaken they really were.

I love how clear the charts are and how clear the author is at explaining the topic. This topic felt so out of my reach but this book actually allowed me to understand. He writes in a way that doesn't make you feel like you belong at the middle school reading level. It definitely reads like an everyday person's book but with the knowledge and research of a doctor or scholar.I would suggest leaving every preconceived notion at the door. I read some reviews about this book that don't have anything to do with the book. That's unfortunate because it really is an informative book.It gets into incredible detail on wireless signals.

I didn't know it when he introduced them that I was suffering from overexposure and that I had become, or maybe always was, ehs (electrically hyper-sensitive). I want to say that Mercola and his information was instrumental in saving my quality of life. I've listened to every podcast of his about EMFs. Every podcast from Dr. Martin Pall, Dave Asprey, Brian Hoyer, Jack Kruse, Peter Sullivan and more. And yet still Mercola managed to provide new information. The level of depth he offers about the telecom industry, and activism around the world is impressive and thoroughly unique. It's clear his passion, commitment, and depth of understanding.Mercola has put together a thorough compilation of the history, politics, scientific research, biological effects, mitigation techniques and health strategies to arm ourselves against the storm of damage to all biological systems that are EMFs.If you're like I was 3 years ago when I moved to what I now call the \"emf house\", you may be already effected and have no idea. Here are just a few symptoms I experienced with EMFs:- headaches/ migraines- tinnitus- waking up in the night- mind racing before bed / trouble falling asleep- arthritis- anxiety- bad dental hygiene- brain fog- depression- hair, skin and nail health issues....Some of these are directly explained in the book, and all of them are explained by non native EMFs.It was definitely a mind bend when I first realized what I was experiencing for years was caused by electricity. It's like realizing you're in the matrix. But once I did, soooo many things started falling into place. And now I don't have most of those, and thankfully my hair is getting fuller :). This book is a gift. It's a one stop shop to learn all that I've learned in one place. It's dense at times, but it's all essential information.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R31EE5VU4O9V93","asin":{"original":"1401958753","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020","date":{"date":"February 23, 2020","unix":1582419600},"name":"Brian Hoyer FNTP","rating":5,"title":"The health damaging effects of non-ionizing, non-thermal EMFs is REAL!","review":"Dr. Mercola shows this clearly in this well documented book.Many very intelligent people still adhere to outdated dogma about non-ionizing EMFs...believing that it is only thermal levels that can damage DNA and impair the human body through heating of tissue.These people are simply behind on the research and if they approach this topic with an open mind they will discover the truth about some of the damaging effects of non-ionizing radiation.This book would be a great place to start for any open skeptic.Not only does Dr. Mercola cite thousands of studies showing the effects of man made EMF, he also has interviewed many experts in preparation for this book being published and is able to explain the multiple cellular mechanisms of damage that happen.This is the type of detail that has been desperately needed to help guide researchers and medical professionals in designing better studies so we can further understand the extent of the type of damage being done beyond a simple illness diagnosis or tumor that develops YEARS after exposure.We shouldn't wait for all of us to be epidemiological statistics!This book shows that there is proof that non-ionizing radiation is NOT harmless and we should take care to protect ourselves from it in order to OPTIMIZE our health.It's not just about not getting cancer...it is about inflammation and damage that is done that destroys our quality of life and contributes to many ailments that people suffer from every day.Protecting yourself from this damage is the empowering part of the book.This is NOT a book that tells you to buy a product that will magically protect you from all EMF.In fact, there is a section in the book where he recommends avoiding the types of products that do not have a scientifically measurable reduction in EMF.Bottom line is that there are REAL solutions that incorporate real hard science of physics to help guide people in reducing their exposures to levels that are more similar to what humans have historically been exposed to for thousands or millions of years.Faraday cages, opting for battery operated DC (direct current) over AC (alternating current) options, grounding products to reduce voltage exposure, filtering harmonics to protect our electrical nervous systems from distortion fields.These are all real life problems that electrical engineers who work on any intricate circuit board know about.It is not so far fetched to think the body is ALSO an intricate web of 'circuits' that run off of electricity and can be interfered with in the same way.The difference is that there are also chemical reactions that happen in response to the voltage changes in the body, which cause inflammation and direct damage to our mitochondria.Again, Dr. Mercola goes into great detail about exactly what happens on a cellular level in the book.Another very valuable part of this book is the section on supporting the body to deal with the damage done by EMF exposure.Because we now better understand the mechanism of damage, thanks to the research put together in this book, there are many practical ways to support various pathways in the body that are depleted or damaged due to these exposures.EMF is everywhere and in our present world we can't always avoid it, but we can at least support our bodies in dealing with the stress and create an EMF free space for ourselves at night when the body repairs itself.I was given an advanced copy of this book and helped add some advice in the remediation chapter of the book.I so appreciate all the work that was put into EMF*D.It is easy to read and understand but also has the in depth science and explanations that you'd expect from an academic point of view.In summary, Dr. Mercola breaks everything down about EMF concerns so that you are empowered not only with the information about the damaging effects of EMF but also given resources on how to practically reduce your exposure. There are resources for how to test things yourself with certain EMF meters or hire a professional that can do the testing for you, ultimately recommending the appropriate shielding measures. He also gives you a personal health strategy for mitigating the effects biologically with diet, supplementation, and specific types of exercise.Thank you Dr. Mercola!This book is an instant classic and is ahead of its time!Brian Hoyer, FNTPShielded Healing","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R2RDMDFXW9JSNS","asin":{"original":"1401958753","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020","date":{"date":"February 23, 2020","unix":1582419600},"name":"Eliyahu B.","rating":5,"title":"Very informative","review":"Very informative stuff, as usual.

We should care because many believers will or are being swayed by the demonic influences of this movement.The QAnon movement frequently engages in slander, which James calls demonic behavior (James 3:15–16). The QAnon movement often traffics in lies, which Jesus says are associated with Satan. The QAnon movement repeatedly sides with demonically inspired falsehoods that divide professed Christians from faithful believers. And the QAnon movement has a tendency to call evil that which is good, and good that which is evil, and to put darkness for light, and light for darkness (Isa. 5:20).

Whats even crazier, is that after the initial release of this book In August, the “news” and events that occur just add to the book itself, ie Trump getting the virus 110 days after his June 14th birthday, or KellyAnne Conway getting it the exact same day, 110 days before her January 20th birthday. An example in this book such as how Flight 77 hit the 77 foot tall Pentagon, where DC sits on the 77th meridian West, 77 minutes after taking off. No coincidence. You’ll learn the importance of 102 like 102 minutes that changed America, or 201 like event 201 and the Jesuits.You’ll learn why 77 is an important American Number, what makes 110 an important number, or what makes the number 47 so important to the cabal, like how building 7 randomly collapsed that day, into dust along with her 110 story sister buildings, was 47 stories tall.This is TRUE knowledge, and will TRULY connect the dots for you and make you nod your head while reading through it saying “wow, this is incredible”. Not only is the author Zachary K Hubbard a great writer, dedicated to the core, but he is also a good man with a great heart, and i’m proud to be part of a movement that isn’t your basic or stereotypical“conspiracy theorist” or “controlled opposition” mockery that has become movements under the likes of Alex Jones, and other nut cases who make a jest by providing half truth, only to make a comment about homosexual frogs.This work is undeniable. It’s true to its nature, and even when breaking out of this ridiculous matrix we live in, it can be scary, it’s also a lot of fun.Please consider getting this book, if you know something is “wrong” in this world but you can’t find exactly Who, What, When, Where, How and Why they do it, this will certainly help you, and can change your life.Thank you to the Author, who has changed by life and many of our lives all together.

I had to buy the paperback and the Kindle version!","review":"In a world filled with many sheep. and a book filled with so much TRUTH. I ordered over 20 copies! Number Games by Mr. Hubbard could quite possibly be the most important piece of literature in our modern day 21st century. From 9/11 to Coronavirus. If you don't agree, then I would recommend you READ his first book Letters and Numbers, a book that should be and needs to be in the hands of every student in every school curriculum across the Earth. Everything we know has a power, has an energy, a. feeling a vibration. and letters and numbers that we create words with hold a positive and negative vibration, Even the things we don't see. have an energy, a feeling, a vibration, or what we can translate as its mathematical equivalent. We are no different. I can't express how important and essential these books are now, and will be in the future as we have been documenting and witnessing in essence, the fall of man. The inclination in technology, and the declination of the common man, whose common sense isn't common anymore. Knowledge is power, and we are witnessing the powers that shouldn't, that have had this knowledge and much more, as well as the means to hone and manipulate power. We have seen this used in such sophistication and used in such keen and clever ways, it only makes you think of that one character in that Holy Book described as the Master Deceiver. Growing up in Southern California in a city that has the nickname \"The Media City\" or which I love to call \"Psyop City\"right next to Hollywood, just over the hill in Burbank, California. Home to mostly every mainstream media news outlet these two cities. Born in ProvidenceSt. Joseph Hospital on Buena Vista st., where John Ritter died. Whom I used to love watching as a kid on Three's Company. Coincidentally that hospital which I'm sure many celebrities have been born and also passed away is across the street from Walt Disney Studios. I remember not living very far andjogging right by there and seeing that big Walt Disney Co, logo, and well, I guess you know what I'm hinting at. It was my birthday last week and I just turned 36, which was the number of my favorite football player Jerome Bettis. Three Sixes, well I think you all can see the correlation. And if you don't, pick up this book now and you will see beyond thoughts and things and the manifestation of bringing positive things into existence.You will soon come to find that there are people in this world that use these things and this knowledge and much more in the opposite form. We are living under divisive times, and you have the power and the freedom to find truth, as our freedoms have been gradually purged. This is the beginning of the culmination of what is to come. So I hope people can understand the God Code Gematria for what it is, and not overanalyze letters and number.s . And for all the truth seekers out there, remember there is a difference between his truth, your truth and the truth. Fill your temple and spirit with knowledge and grace. There is a beginning and ending to all things. Gematria is truth, and helps you see through the real lies so realize. The Gematria community, is the truth community and the only community with an ancientpractice that exposes the lies so you can see through the real deception we are witnessing. While the rest of the world is in this paradox or paradigm of Democracy, and who to vote for next? Well no matter who you (select.)t iI can see very clear now in 2020 thanks to Zachary K. Hubbard. I've seen Mr. Hubbard put out truth and expose the lies and mockery and document the truth for what it is,. and is something that I will always be thankful for.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1TV79OZJMM46P","asin":{"original":"1098329864","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2020","date":{"date":"October 13, 2020","unix":1602547200},"name":"Shar-Meme ","rating":5,"title":"It's the breakdown for me!","review":"I'm so proud to be a supporter of Zach's great work!This book covers all the subjects that I constantly talk about daily with others.Trying to share this information with my friends is made easier now having my book in hand.I got my book the week Donald Trump caught Corona virus.

Whether you are Muslim (like I am), Christian, Catholic, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, or some other religion, or even an agnostic or an atheist, I recommend that you consider reading this book. God willing, it will change your life. The numbers add up to something, and it is not according to the narrative of what we were taught in school. Even if you do not agree with all of the views disseminated on Gematria Effect News (Zachary Hubbard's current YouTube channel), I believe that we can use toolkits like this book to inspire real, grassroots change that can overturn the Orwellian agendas currently in play by the powers that should not be.

The book is pretty hard to get into if you are not already aware of the codes, but Zach does his best giving you the information that is extremely important to understand.

The author clearly demonstrates, better than anyone else, the explanatory, even the predictive power of Gematria. Now that I have read this book, I will never see news stories or even historical events in the same light. There are certain patterns of numbers that appear again and again in major events and sadly, in the deaths of public people.Hubbard has free online tools that enable you to do your own decoding of names, events and trends in the news. I also recommend his first book, \"Letters and Numbers\", which is not available on Amazon, but is easily found on the author's website. It goes more deeply into the theory, mechanics and meaning.There are many books on Gematria relating to specific topics, but none are as comprehensive and analytical as Hubbard's books.

Stewart","rating":5,"title":"Fascinating Disclosure of How to Weaponize a Virus for Political and Commercial Gain","review":"Dr. Simone Gold has first rate credentials (board certified ER physician, JD Stanford Law) and would seemingly be beyond the twitter world and its cancel culture, but not so.Het short tale of her experiences with mendacious hospital administrators and the publishers of what were once distinguished medical journals is alarming and needs to be read by anyone who professes to support self government.She presents a great deal of previous research that supports the use of HCQ in the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and then traces the use of phony research published in influential medical journals to undermine the body of knowledge that supports HCQ.One of the outfits that created fake research published in Lancet was SurgiSphere, which she describes as a six employee company including one science fiction writer and an adult model who was available as an event hostess.Their fictional contribution to our public health was quietly withdrawn, but the deception they created lingers in the public sphere.Even the AMA got on the anti-HCQ bandwagon, but they didn't offer event management services.None of the adverse publicity for the use of HCQ rebutted past research, it was just the exercise of seemingly credentialed authority.Those responsible for this initiative in the PR realm would be well served to remember that respect is a perishable substance when authority is mindlessly employed.The author then speculates on the political and commercial considerations that might motivate such unreasonable behavior.LIke the author, I am puzzled by a great deal of this.Can we have fallen to such a point that the deaths of tens of thousands of us can be ignored in pursuit of wealth and power?Whatever the motivation, it is becoming very clear that we are living in a time of intentional deception using mass hysteria, fake research, and coordinated social media campaigns to whip the public into fits of folly.I am reminded of Hearst's 1898 telegram to Remington, \"You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war\", on the eve of the Spanish American War. It was called yellow journalism.It was used foment war, but, of course, the goals of the war were said to be good.Today it is called the cancel culture.It is supposed to protect the feelings of our tender little snowflakes, or to protect the public from a virus by using face masks, but the reality is very different.It is actually used to suppress knowledge and dissent, both of which serve as feedback that is desperately needed as our institutions lurch from one mistake to another with hardly a thought. Buy this book if only to exercise your 1st Amendment right to enjoy reading a controversial essay.E-books may soon be the sole repository of free speech as the cancel culture grows more pervasive.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R28EXJSXQ6SWKH","asin":{"original":"B08L8JK7FL","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2020","date":{"date":"December 2, 2020","unix":1606870800},"name":"Bt","rating":5,"title":"Dealing with medical cancel culture.","review":"A must read to understand how effective HCQ is for this pandemic.Enlightening to see how cancel culture promotes disinformation rather than truth and good data.I only wish the book was longer it had so much good stuff in it.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RHUF4KVG3PYBX","asin":{"original":"B08L8JK7FL","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020","date":{"date":"December 1, 2020","unix":1606784400},"name":"Cynthia Herrmann","rating":5,"title":"Read this if you think k there is more to the shutdowns than meets the eye","review":"SimoneGold writes clearly why you should believe the media re the corona virus and how to conduct your own research about this vs to determine what is fact and what is not.Excellent book.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RU1H3KH0W5PTT","asin":{"original":"B08L8JK7FL","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020","date":{"date":"December 1, 2020","unix":1606784400},"name":"Bethany Wahl","rating":5,"title":"Every American needs to read this!","review":"This is outstanding and will be a history book in 10 years of the truth behind the Covid scandal!

Dr. Simone Gold lays out the facts and misinformation associated with the drug hydroxychloroquine and how two of the most influential research studies that changed public opinion about the drug to more negative, were, in fact, retracted. One of them conducted in Brazil and published in “The Lancet” is now under criminal investigation for the deaths of many elderly patients after being given 2.5 times the lethal dose of this generic drug. Something the MSM never spoke up about. This is only a small part of what this book addresses in how medical professionals are being silenced through fear and manipulated by other powers through fraudulent research studies.One thing that I appreciate the most about this book is that Dr. Simone Gold offers steps of how to find and identify true research or articles and how to do independent research yourself to find answers to your questions. One of my favorite points is that she suggests looking back on information you can find on subjects before controversy hit. She had been doing research on hydroxychloroquine since the beginning of this year. Looking back on journals and other research studies proving the safety of this drug and its already billions of uses. Yes, BILLIONS.It’s really disheartening to see the reality of manipulated research studies on this drug and the author takes us step by step through her own journey since the beginning of this pandemic.In recommend this book to anyone who is willing to consider another perspective and see the reality of the current medical field through the lenses of a frontline medical emergency physician.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2A0XDJBNRKS4Q","asin":{"original":"B08L8JK7FL","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2020","date":{"date":"October 29, 2020","unix":1603933200},"name":"Marilyn","rating":5,"title":"Truth!","review":"I know someone personally who has consulted with America's Frontline Drs, received an evaluation and prescription for Covid symptoms.

Stemming from the COVID-19 “pandemic” crisis initiated in the first months of 2020, fear has permeated our lives. Egged on by government authority with its minions of press and police, fear defines our day-to-day. A gap in global community life has opened through which freedom escapes and the vacuum replaced by authoritarian rule. Dr. Vernon Coleman, medical establishment gadfly, has offered us a voice of sanity in the chaos with his book, Coming Apocalypse.A Crisis Commentary with PredictionsDr. Coleman’s book is a commentary with predictions on the 2020 COVID-19 “pandemic” event. It is presented in three parts.The first part is Dr. Coleman’s summary view of the event. He avers that this crisis is far more than is being presented to us, and is in fact, a fight for our very survival. Not against the virus, but against the “cure.”The second part is Dr. Coleman’s diary of the unfolding “pandemic” from Feb 28, 2020 to April 22, 2020. These “entries” are his take on events as they happened, recounting alleged case numbers, alleged death numbers, and imposed lock-downs (”house arrests”). The diary also traces the evolution of Dr. Coleman’s thinking about the crisis. While he considered the whole thing a hoax from the start, his opinions on various aspects became grimmer over the three months.The third part is Dr. Coleman’s predictions of how the implementation of the crisis “cure” will play out. They are presented in thirty-six categories. These include Brexit, Demonstrations, Inoculations, Social-Distancing, Hospitals, Social Services, Police, Politics, Travel, etc.Lastly, there is a brief “Conclusion.” The book’s title should provide a strong indication as to the nature of that conclusion.Short Length - Dense ContentsIn a Foreword (VERY IMPORTANT NOTE), Dr. Coleman says he had to remove the words, “COVID-19” and “vaccine” or “vaccination” in order to publish his book. The book is “independently published” and is part of Kindle Unlimited, so I assume the Amazon KDP process imposed the restrictions. For me, that supports Dr. Coleman’s conclusions.Coming Apocalypse is relatively short (132 pages) but meaty in content. The “diary” section is not so much a chronicle of events, as it is a chronicle of Dr. Coleman’s reactions to events. His consequent commentary is a contrast to media propaganda and worth expending some thought on.You’ll see some repetition in the diary entries as the crisis hits certain points. These indicate Dr. Coleman’s major concerns, high among which is the crisis’ impact on the elderly. Dr. Coleman avers that a large component of the crisis is to reduce the population of people over the age of seventy. Governments would thus reduce their costs on health care (national program in Britain; insurance-based in the US) and on pensions.Dr. Coleman notes that Britain’s “emergency bill” came days after public health organizations removed the virus from classification as a “high consequence infectious disease.” That bill created, nationally in Britain, the “lock down” conditions that were imposed state-by-state in the US.Another goal of the crisis, Dr. Coleman believes, is the creation of a cashless society. Checks and currency will be replaced with plastic and something digital. Other commentators echo this belief, as well as the possibility of a vaccine being forced on people.Woven through the diary, are Dr. Coleman’s notes on the case and death numbers reported by the mainstream. He notes these as fraudulent, or misleading at best. Again, echoing other commentators, he notes that the numbers for the seasonal flu are far higher. His consequent theme is that the “cure” will kill more people than the virus.The Part Three section of predictions is lengthy and divided into thirty-six categories. It is worth careful pondering. Among Dr. Coleman’s many predictions are:* Checks and currency will disappear quickly.* Social distancing will become permanent.* Public gatherings will be effectively outlawed.* Globalization is finished due to a renewed nationalism. (I disagree with this one, if I understand Dr. Coleman correctly. I think the working of this crisis is revealing a world ruling structure that has actually been operating for a long time).* Increased pressure to vaccinate. Possibly forced.* Remote work will be a motivation for people to migrate to the countryside. (I disagree. A major purpose of this crisis is the ramping up of implementing the UN Agenda 21, which includes moving people to the cities. There will be pressures to keep people out of the countryside).Droll Humor for a Dark Subject with a British PerspectiveDr. Coleman is a capable, clever, and prolific writer. Being a medical doctor (though no longer practicing) who has long written on health matters, he brings a credible, critical view to the crisis. His prose is eminently readable and laced with his droll humor.Bear in mind, however, that Dr. Coleman is British and so his views are mostly from the British perspective. Hence, some events and references to government may require the American reader some Googling to understand. Also, some expressions and spellings are British and will confound a US English Kindle Reader app. It’s not bad enough to be a problem, though.Not a Pandemic — Something Else is HappeningI can easily and highly recommend this book and Dr. Coleman’s other writings and videos for understanding the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic hoax. The fact that he was unable to get this book published when it contained the words, “COVID-19” and “vaccination,” is both telling and ominous.I do not think that calling this time “apocalyptic” is too extreme. In my opinion, we are going through the most significant realignment of human society in ten thousand years. This is not happening because of a virus pandemic. It is an agenda of oligarch rulers long in the planning and being executed on schedule. This is World War III being fought against we-the-people. This book can help us see that.I’ll end this review with a quote from Coming Apocalypse with which I completely agree:...the bottom line is that we are heading for an apocalypse and we are going to have to trust ourselves and one another because we certainly cannot trust our so-called leaders or their advisors...Amen and Right On!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R5YSK6U5JZRV8","asin":{"original":"B087WCFSC7","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2020","date":{"date":"July 7, 2020","unix":1594080000},"name":"Russell L.

His publishers required that he left out the mention of two words from his manuscript.One is to do with the name of the virus c-19, the other as regards the cure, a 'v' word synonymous with inoculation; such is the sensitivity towards censorship in the world we live in today.As I write this review at the beginning of August 2020, we have been in Lockdown for many months.The deadly effects of the biological pathogen have mercifully been experienced by relatively few, but everyone has experienced the panic effects, the mass hysteria, the mask controversy, social distancing and the flip-flopping of the UK government as regards policy.Dr Coleman presents an intelligent and well thought out summary of the effect of lockdown, in particular on the elderly and most vulnerable.He is critical of the 'scientists' who have been advising the government, their often-poor track record, and their 'ivory tower' attitude.It is an approach that has not considered an exit strategy, so unlike the 'Herd Immunity' approach initially adopted, Lockdown is doomed to kill more people than the pathogen itself. The cancelled operations and the lack of screening of cancer patients for example. The cure will be much worse than the disease.He also sees this as a power grab by western governments, who will be reluctant to surrender their emergency powers if and when this is all over.A recipe for the establishment of a totalitarian regime. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a free thinker and who wants to understand what is really going on.It is not an easy read and can be somewhat soporific to those who like things to be pleasant and comforting.I'd give it a miss if you get distressed easily, as it will likely make you more anxious.

Agree or disagree at least you will have seen some contrasting evidence to the twaddle churned out by many in the government.Statistics can say anything.This is a nasty bug, if you get it bad it is bad, really bad.And BAME seem to be the victims of really bad infection.I have nursed through the TB, HIV,SARS, Hepatitis (still highly prevelant and carried in all body fluids)etc epidemics and of course the one the press loved – MRSA infections.None of which I caught.This was for two reasons1.widespread availability of adequate and appropriate PPE2.we were taught face to face and assessed on our competence in using the appropriate PPE....and if we could not demonstrate understanding and fluidity of using then we failed and had to retrain until we did gain competence.You mustn't fail anyone nowadays, it might upset them.Nowadays, you are taught using e learning platform, no assessment – well a tick box, that if you get it wrong you just redo ticking different answers until you get the required percentage to pass.Or you get a colleague to do it for you.And you don't usually need 100% to pass – why on earth not?Using PPE inappropriately is widely acknowledged to INCREASE risk to both colleagues, staff and patients.E platform is quick, easy and cheap – all all too often not understood by those for whom english is not their first languageAnd under the 1974 H/S at Work Act the government has a legal duty to provide appropriate adequate safety equipment – well PPE is certainly this!And they failed, despite warnings each year and from WHO in 2019, but of course no-one will ever be held accountable. Just moved sideways, probably with a promotion.So yes this book is not perfect but is does demonstrate the widespread perception of the government response being conflicting, confusing, detrimental to the elderly and of course – utterly shambolic.That is not to say that ANY government would not have been as inconsistent; but undoubtedly they were very poorly prepared and at least some of this must surely be down to financial constringency (consistent governments for years had been warned of poor prepararedness but ignored the warnings ) and arrogance.Would responses have been more rapid/consistent if those in charge had a modicom of clinical knowledge or experience?Who knows; but this experienced clinician writing the bookhas certainly been 'sidelined' for not towing the line and having the temerity for not only thinking outside of the box but also stating it!Funny that, I always thought that freedom of speech was what my dad fought throughout the second world war for!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1APKQKIZTRD2S","asin":{"original":"B087WCFSC7","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in Canada on July 12, 2020","date":{"date":"July 12, 2020","unix":1594512000},"name":"Barbara Shinton","title":"coming apocalypse","review":"I just finished reading this great book. very informative and is very well written for anyone to understand.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1QVTIWQX2V8D1","asin":{"original":"B087WCFSC7","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on July 12, 2020","date":{"date":"July 12, 2020","unix":1594512000},"name":"Kindle Customer","title":"Bit disappointing.","review":"Most of the book is a diary Vernon Coleman kept during the lockdown and his thoughts on it.

It makes the case that there is nothing extraordinary about SARS-CoV-2 compared to other coronaviruses or influenza viruses. It shows how the case numbers are unreliable so policy should not be based on them and how the death numbers are easily manipulated based on what is considered a \"death.\" Study after study is referenced showing the death rate is actually quite small and it also shows that lockdown measures, masks, and other mitigation techniques did nothing to help and may have even hurt.I would recommend this book for anyone who is starting to question the narrative. Some people are clearly too far gone into the propaganda to ever come back, regardless of what facts are presented to them (Yuri Bezmenov stated this would happen with demoralization) but a lot of people are starting to see the absurdity of things now and this will help push them over the fence.Those who proclaim to love science sure don't do much of it.

The prose is well written and I didn't find any grammatical errors - something that can take away from the enjoyment of reading a book. There are 10 chapters, but, strangely, they are not numbered in the body of the book. There's also a long list of references, but no Index section. The book is an easy read.The book is packed with true information (facts). The authors are actual experts in the study of viruses, and other phages, and appear to understand what an epidemic is and how it works. Though they write from their first hand experience with the epidemic as it took place in Germany (the book is translated from the German version), the information and the events they describe are exactly the same as those for the United States and other countries.Importantly, they describe how the government and the media have exaggerated the impact of the virus and have pushed an alarmist agenda and conducted fear mongering in order to control the public (sounds like what is taking place in the U.S.). COVID-19 is compared to other causes of deaths of people over 80 years old such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and respiratory infections, and the number of viral deaths is shown to be insignificant! By the way 1.2 million people die in auto accidents every year, though the media doesn't publish much of these incidents - it's just a statistic. Information is also presented which describes the development of the vaccines. The authors state that a number of safety checks have been bypassed in order to bring the vaccines to market quickly. I'm sure the officers of each drug company are jumping for joy. Did you think that the pharmaceutical industry was really being charitable? The taxpayers are footing the bill! So, with all of the shortcuts being taken, it's questionable whether the vaccines are really safe. The authors point this out in the book. With this information in mind, I'm not taking the vaccine.The book was published in October 2020. So, unfortunately, we don't have the authors' comments regarding the existence of a second wave of COVID infections. However, they did state that the peak of the viral infections took place during April 2020.So, turn off the news. Put down the newspapers. Take some deep breaths and relax. Make a cup of tea or eat something very delicious and take a walk outside! Get back to living a normal life. The authors have stated - and I believe they have successfully made the point - that COVID is no worse than the flu and life should go on.I highly recommend the book!Raphael KetaniSunnyside, NY","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R67V4VSZAYKR","asin":{"original":"B08JCDV25M","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2020","date":{"date":"November 28, 2020","unix":1606525200},"name":"Robert J","rating":5,"title":"What the science says about Covid-19","review":"A great book about the Covid-19 by two knowledgeable German doctors.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1HTMB0SD1OE20","asin":{"original":"B08JCDV25M","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2020","date":{"date":"November 27, 2020","unix":1606438800},"name":"Ronald E.

The effects of the lockdown are far more dangerous than any virus, especially this one, could ever be.This original version of the book was written months ago and there are new facts always popping up but the way viruses work and transmit do not change.Dr. Reiss and Dr. Bhakdi outline how:-- the standard PCR testing for the virus was rushed, without quality assurance, offering up huge amounts of false positives.-- covid-19 is a designation that, really, only belongs to the 10% of infected individuals with severe illness. Thus, the \"covid-19 cases\" are improperly labeled and pushed.-- any death with a positive test is listed as a covid death, thus inflating mortality.-- government officials in Germany conspired to make things look worse than they were.-- the risk is very low for most people and children. schools should have never closed.-- background immunity to the virus from T-Cells or lymphocytes is apparent in roughly 50% of the population so we are closer to natural Herd Immunity than we thought. We were lied to, being told this virus is totally novel with no existing immunity.-- censorship has been implemented worldwide like never seen in the modern era.-- the WHO seems to be being much of the censorship and misinformation on the subject.-- corporations have profited during the crisis (Amazon?) and much has been fueled by the vaccine producers' drive for a 20/1 return on their investment, hoping to mandate injections for 7 billion people, all of earth.This is not conspiracy theory. This is criminal negligence by our leaders at best and most likely corporate-government criminal collusion.Interestingly the Germans seem to be the most woke on the subject, with massive lockdown protests, perhaps sensing a scenario similar to their 1933—now on a global scale.Yikes.We ask for open debate worldwide and this book is a must-read for all critical thinkers no matter what their beliefs on the subject.Thank you Dr. Reiss & Dr. Bhakdi","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3EGX7G2LFN9TI","asin":{"original":"B08JCDV25M","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2020","date":{"date":"October 12, 2020","unix":1602460800},"name":"DS","rating":5,"title":"Excellent wake-up call.Thank you.","review":"That’s it.I’m grateful to the authors for their worthy attempt at injecting some sanity into the midst of this madness.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RG1W26B89LSYG","asin":{"original":"B08JCDV25M","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2020","date":{"date":"October 11, 2020","unix":1602374400},"name":"wendy","rating":5,"title":"here are the facts","review":"Very easy to understand and honest","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3GZ6NIMZCBUW","asin":{"original":"B08JCDV25M","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2020","date":{"date":"October 9, 2020","unix":1602201600},"name":"NURSE_RON","rating":5,"title":"Extraordinary Book, Amazing Links To 100's of Ref., Well Written","review":"I have been pleasantly surprised by this book.

It's not perfect & doesn't seem to claim to be but gives a wealth of source material for those who want to check further. One observation for example that I wasn't sure about was in referring to the uniqueness of the situation in GB, namely the \"problems with the NHS & lack of expert skills due to Brexit\" - my understanding is that in the April peak, the NHS was still overall only at 60% capacity & that the freedom of movement restrictions with Brexit start in 2021. In GB it seemed like weaker testing capacity was more the issue in terms of understating the number of infections.

I was aware for some time that nothing in this “Pandemic” has made sense from the draconian measures brought upon the heads of the British public to all subsequent actions taken. There has been little logic or science based evidence in play, most disturbing is the suppression of any dissenting voices. SAGE is the modern day pied piper leading the government and the general population over the cliff. My question is why are we allowing this to happen? All mainstream media is complicit in perpetuating the misinformation of this viral infection, the government have become spineless and the majority of the population have swallowed this hook, line and sinker.

Hay","title":"An Important Book for a Balanced Perspective","review":"I bought this book after hearing Dr Heiko Schöning refer to it after he was released from 22 hours in police custody having been arrested before speaking at a Trafalger Square rally a few weeks ago. He struck me as a very reputable man who had been treated horribly by the British State and it really contributed to my already huge unease about the management of information about this topic. His phone, laptop and this book were seized by police. All of this contributed to my concern about information management. Why are we subjected to many briefings by so called medical experts with huge ties to big pharma and yet this reputable doctor is treated so badly? Why are decent doctors demonised and smeared? I have had my own thoughts for a long time and having read this book, it clarified these thoughts further.It's a very well written, professional account of facts relating to Covid which do not support the current narrative. It does not deny its existence but offers a perspective that has been largely demonised by the media/establishment. It outlines how fear has been generated and talks of one German document aiming to create a perception among the public that this involves dying in a way akin to a long slow drowning as a means of maximising fear.All I would ask is that people read this book with an open mind. Doctors across the globe are being punished for speaking out. In the current climate, they have far more to lose than gain from doing so, which makes their message all the more important. One comment left in a review anda very small number of reviewers totally rubbished the authors without any substance to support their view. Such is the damage done by project fear and not having a balanced debate about proportionality and what is actually effective in terms of dealing with this issue.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3GXOPVGR98A9H","asin":{"original":"B08JCDV25M","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on October 26, 2020","date":{"date":"October 26, 2020","unix":1603674000},"name":"Dr Roger Higgs","title":"Covid truth at last","review":"This magnificent inexpensive little book (just 136 pages) has taken Germany by storm and will astonish you.

Everyone who listens to the government's top echelons at organizations like the CDC and NIAID and believes that these are credible scientists of integrity needs to read this book.

From my other background as editor of many articles and books it seems it could use another round hence 4 stars.Nevertheless, the 19 stars I cannot award under Amazon’s system are wholly for courage, depth and passion in delivering a message whose time has come: if my understanding is clear, between the lines I read that the concept of vaccination is completely valid. Unfortunately, in its execution the medical establishment appears to choose a path of least resistance (which it defends tooth and nail) with undue regard for the lives of those that are harmed as a result, no matter how statistically small the numbers in their opinion.Both my parents have already passed away and they had me at was then an advanced age (mother was 36), but from what I remember of my childhood I used to be smart, alert and outgoing, yet I grew increasingly introvert, slow in thinking and intimidated by others as I received one childhood vaccination after another. I scored 24 points on a 50 point autism test where autism starts at 25 points. My girlfriend scored 9 points and she had no empathy for my challenges. That relationship didn’t last long.Judy describes for the first time in my life how I feel. I can’t imagine what it feels for those who have full blown autism. Where I wish her enthusiasm had been curbed a little to come across perhaps a bit more convincing, the authors make up for it by providing some extremely useful discussions on cellular functioning.The parts on HIV and its political journey are something I can relate to 100% - because I met two scientists from South Africa who devised a cure, helped countless yet were told by the post-Apartheid government to get lost. Black lives appear to not matter at all outside the USA in case you were wondering. Needless to say Henk and Mariëtte Van Wyk did leave their home country only to be told the same thing in the US as of the date of this writing.Some people seem to live in fear - as if they have a thousand years to live. Some people lie to others because of that fear. Others just practice self-deception and believe that what the liars say has to be true because the liars are in authority. Maybe we will only emerge into a new era of understanding when we identify the liars for good. In the meantime, Plague of Corruption seems to do a great job exposing the lie behind vaccination. If only it would have included an expose of what ingredients would contribute to a safe version of existing vaccines, and perhaps something more on why, however speculative, harmful and toxic ingredients may have been selected for inclusion, it would have been more perfect than it already is.

The unintentional spread of the monkey kidney disease SV-40 to millions is a conveniently forgotten chapter in the history of the polio vaccine.

Fate has pushed Mikovits to center stage; she has literally become THE lynchpin for taking down this entire corrupt murderous house of cards.She's fearless and unstoppable.In short, she is a national treasure and ought to be treated accordingly.This is one of the most important books to be published in 2020 and should be on your list of must-reads (near the top, as time is short and no less than the future of this nation is at stake).Mikovits and Heckenlively have an earlier book, Plague, but this one is better written, better organized and easier to understand due to science terms being better explained than in their first book.For this reason, I recommend reading this book first and then move on to her first book to go more in depth.She also did a fantastic book called \"The Case Against Masks: Ten Reasons Why Mask Use Should be Limited\" which I purchased on Amazon but is not longer available (censored?).The book references loads of scientific studies and her views are corroborated by many other scientists.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RAMGFUDCAP37U","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2020","date":{"date":"November 6, 2020","unix":1604624400},"name":"Don Anderson","rating":5,"title":"Must Read","review":"The author goes into great detail into big pharma and our Federal Government corruption.This is a must read for all!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R26ESZASRZBA5R","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020","date":{"date":"November 5, 2020","unix":1604538000},"name":"Maria","rating":5,"title":"EXCELLENT","review":"Great book.

Mikovits/Ruscetti also found a ~80% correlation between XMRVs and CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome).It's important to note that a CAUSAL relationship wasn't confirmed, only a correlation.Mikovits contends that top US public health officials (Fauci and Collins) forced her to retract her publication and ruined her career in order to \"protect\" the reputation of the US blood supply.She also says the US govt has quietly bought medical equipment, which Mikovits confirmed can eliminate XMRVs from the blood supply.The most disturbing part of this section are the several doctors and scientists who (allegedly) committed suicide. Mikovits questions if these were truly suicides but can't prove anything more sinister.The second half of the book discusses vaccine safety and Mikovits' belief that vaccines really are a causal factor in autism as well.She also says that vaccines impair the immune system overall and may be a factor in other conditions besides CFS and autism.I used to be pro-vaccine but reading \"How to End the Autism Epidemic\" changed my mind.So I'm mostly in agreement with Mikovits' critique of vaccines.However, I can only give this book 3 stars because it's poorly organized and rambling and overly speculative.My guess is that the book was \"written\" by transcribing conversations with the co-author.Mikovits has also attracted attention by speculating that SARS-COV-2 (the virus that supposedly causes COVID-19) only causes a severe illness in people who also have a XMRV.But this is unproven and COVID-19 is not mentioned in the book.Bottom-Line:If XMRVs do turn out to be an important factor in health, then this book will be remembered as a landmark work despite all of the flaws.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2GUG8YOROY3WE","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2020","date":{"date":"September 3, 2020","unix":1599091200},"name":"KD9EPX","rating":5,"title":"wonder how ur being lied to???","review":"50 working neurons and an open mind required... science illiterates need not apply..

Busse","rating":2,"title":"Controlled Oppo","review":"I was disappointed in this book, and I don't think the good doctor is being forthcoming. Like many, I discovered Dr. Mikovitz via the film Plandemic, but my view is that Plandemic was created as part of an elaborate campaign by the uniformed epidemiological intelligence service to control the flow of information from the CDC. In that regard, Mikovitz seems a classic propaganda tool: they put out a pseudo heroic whistleblower accompanied with a book, fill it full of juicy limited hangouts, and let the whole thing lead the public into a cul-da-sac.My first question is in regard to Mikovitz's arrest. I've been following the corrupt sheriff's dept. of Ventura County for quite some time, and Geoffry Dean is fully compromised - same with Sheriff Ayub. If you want to get a sense of the facility where Dr. Judy stayed, check out the Ventura County Sheriff \"Lip Sync Challenge\" video on YouTube. Mikovitz (who is a member of a hoity-toity country club north of Port Hueneme) spends a night in in a jail where the deputies sing \"staying alive\" while wiggling their hips and BOOM! She's a heroic suffering whistleblower. Balderdash.Next, Mikovitz has HIV/AIDS completely wrong. Her book coughs up the same tired hypothesis without even engaging with Peter Duesberg or Nobel Prize Winner Kary Mullis. This IN SPITE of the fact that Plandemic discusses Dr. Luc Montagnier - and deciphering his cryptic comments is really the key to a \"plague of corruption\" (and if you want to know the full history of Montagnier, I recommend John Cleushaw's \"Science Fictions\"). This is classic controlled oppo - because the epidemiological flaws of HIV and coronaviruses are so similar and so entertwined, by not discussing the flaws of the HIV hypotheisis at all, Dr. Judy diverts HER AUDIENCE from the trail - in other words, she gets the progressives off the case.And, let's be honest. Anybody who works at Ft. Detrick has a security clearance. Dr. Judy can spout off about XMRV all she want's but as a security cleared individual, she is tighly controlled and following orders.

Judy Mikovits can tell you. She was intimidated, censored, slandered, subjected to surveillance, bankrupted, banned from her profession, and even falsely accused of crime leading to her being held in jail for five days. Worst of all, colleagues in a similar situation were found dead under mysterious circumstances.Is this a realistic account? Do people in high places in industry and government really behave like that? Yes, unfortunately, and not only in the U.S.Mikovits's unpopular research results led her to posit that a host of diseases including cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, autism, diabetes, early Alzheimer, Ebola, HIV (which is not a disease), and more are caused by retroviruses introduced into human bodies through vaccines. All vaccines, she reminds us, are cultivated on tissue from animals such as birds, cows, guinea pigs, horses, mice, and monkeys. Therefore they “break[...] down the barriers nature has erected so that pathogens of one species cannot be easily transferred to humanity and vice versa … one of the major problems with vaccines is that … we don't know what viruses and pathogens are coming back in the needle.” The exceptions are vaccines have been bred on tissue from aborted human fetuses. In addition they contain toxic chemicals such as “mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80 and a host of others.”Earlier I reviewed The Virus and the Vaccine which has a similar message. Then and now I have my doubts about viruses causing (some?) cancer, let alone CFS, diabetes, and Alzheimer. I'm not even fully persuaded viruses exist except in the original meaning of the word: an unknown cause of non-bacterial infectious disease. All the less do I trust the research on retroviruses which are Mikovits's specialty. I applaud that she echoes the criticism I levied in my review of The Virus and the Vaccine, namely that no proper study has been done comparing the lifespan disease history of vaccinated people with those who have never been vaccinated. In what other field of medicine would studies without control groups be acceptable? Without them, neither her claims nor the claims of those who vilify her have a leg to stand on.Mikovits reports having worked for Robert Gallo, either credited with discovering HIV or accused of falsely professing to have done so while actually stealing the glory from French researcher Luc Montagnier, who was rewarded a Nobel prize for it. Gallo has however not been passed up by prizes, as he is the only person to have been awarded two Lasker prizes, the most prestigious prize in US medicine. Mikovits gripes that Gallo “hogs all the credit” while the work was actually done by researchers like herself and her colleagues in his lab. Well, that's the way it is in life. The horse wins the race and the medal is pinned on the jockey. Mikovits boasts three times in the book that it is she who proposed -- “saving the lives of millions” -- that HIV-inhibitors should be prescribed as soon as the person tests positive rather than waiting until symptoms appear. Symptoms of what? AIDS is like schizophrenia. The definition keeps changing as conveniences the medical profession. She herself admits that “HIV does NOT CAUSE AIDSbecause a genetically resistant person can be infected with HIV and never develop AIDS” (caps in the original). So what is the wisdom of taking highly toxic drugs during an entire lifetime for a presumed disease that may never appear, not to mention the unreliability of the tests? Her unequivocal endorsement of the HIV-inhibitors without discussing their drawbacks starkly contrasts against her skeptical position on vaccines.This does not detract from the issue that vaccines are not necessarily safe. There is no such thing as a risk-free medical intervention. Mikovits deserves praise for drawing attention to the risks, even if she has overstated them. Vaccines by nature are administered to healthy people, including infants, with a lot to lose. Mikovits states “Every time the government investigates vaccines, they find problems and they make the decision to cover up the information.” Government propaganda about vaccine safety can be countered by looking at the reports of adverse reactions. In my little country every year one to four infants die as a result of routine vaccinations according to public adverse reaction records. Given the medical taboo for admitting iatrogenic death these incidents are no doubt vastly under-reported.On the other hand, the vaccine deaths must be weighed against the benefits for the vast majority who appear unharmed, namely the presumed prevention of serious illness. The only person who can legitimately do the weighing is the (parent of) the individual involved. MeTZelf does not oppose vaccinations but does oppose all governmental pressure, not to mention coercion, to vaccinate.Regarding the much publicized as well as refuted link between vaccines and autism, it simply happens too often to be ignored. I can't help but notice that medical professionals tend to brush off the possibility of such a link until their own child is affected (Andrew Wakefield, Jon Poling … the first is libeled and ruined, the second receives a $million+ settlement). Vaccinations are surely not the only cause of autism. I suspect it is one of many.On the side, Mikovits reveals an interesting theory regarding the history of what is now called the Americas. The inhabitants who were there already are reported to have had no immunity to the diseases brought by the European conquerors. The theory proposes that the reason Europeans carried so many diseases is because for many centuries they had lived in proximity to animals, mainly domesticated ones kept for food or as pets, but also mice and rats who thrive among humans. In other words, the crossover of viruses from animals to humans has always been a source of disease. She could have lent extra credence to this theory by pointing out that the exchange of diseases does not seem to have been reciprocal. The inhabitants already there did not seem to infect the Europeans with anything except -- according to some but by no means all authorities – syphilis, which is not a virus disease. This theory of disease by association with animals would be a convenient additional argument for vegans. However, it has little to do with what she calls the “cover up” of“lab-derived animal retroviruses.”Plague of Corruption has an excellent eleven-page foreword by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., president Kennedy's nephew.

There is good documentation of this saga online from Science magazine and other sources.As for Big Pharma plotting against her, this makes no sense. Drug companies' profits would skyrocket if Mikovits' claims about retroviruses causing CFS and a host of other chronic diseases were true. They could make many billions of dollars selling anti-retroviral drugs like the ones successfully used to treat HIV/AIDS. Why would drug companies plot against someone whose theories promised to vastly increase their profits?The rest of the book is largely a fact-deprived rant against vaccines, dredging up antivaxers' favorite memes about Toxins, SV40, Andrew Wakefield (who she terms \"our greatest scientific martyr) and so on. Mikovits in an interview answered \"Absolutely not\" when asked if she was antivaccine. It's peculiar then that she spreads so much misinformation about vaccines, has a co-author who proclaims himself ''America's #1 Antivaxxer'', and has a foreword to her book written by noted antivaxer RFK Jr., who has compared vaccination to the Holocaust.People who are susceptible to conspiracy theories and stressed out by the current pandemic are embracing Mikovits' alternate version of reality.

There are so many points in this book that are skewed, biased, try to relate things that are completely unrelated, that the wider public needs to know that this entire book represents a failure of logical thinking. Think of this experiment: An alien contacts us, and has the interesting experience of witnessing a human becoming drunk. The alien confiscates the drink – it doesn’t know what a margarita is. It devises an experiment to determine if it is water or alcohol that makes humans drunk. The alien gathers together four humans, and asks one to drink beer, one to drink wine, one to drink Hennessy, and the fourth to drink Gin. The four drinks have two things in common – and that is water and alcohol. The alien happily concludes that water makes people drunk. Everybody would know that is the wrong conclusion. Here are just a few of the ridiculous points that Judy Mikovits makes.Kindle pg 10: “Mikovits’ evidence threatened financial catastrophe for the world’s pharmaceutical companies because of their negligent use of animal cell cultures to produce vaccines”. “We should not be injecting… aborted human fetal tissue into people”.A basic tenet of biochemistry is that you use the cheapest ingredients to get the job done. Viruses are finicky in that they don’t copy themselves – they need cells to do it. Just like if you want to copy a CD - you need a second CD! The simplest toolbox a biochemist can pull to make this happen is a commercially available cell culture that all biochemists can order online. You need virus particles to manufacture vaccine. The cells are the machinery that can make it for you. This is a near universal technique in labs that want to copy viruses for research. It would be like criticizing a random man who walked down the street with brown shoes, because these shoes were the same color as the suspect who robbed the convenience store last week. Everybody uses shoes – there’s nothing intrinsically negligent about shoes. As for the fetal tissue – the original cell line was derived from fetal lung cells. That cell line has been made into a commercial culture. Fetuses have not been involved in the biochemistry of these cells for decades now.Kindle pg 13: “Beginning in the early 1980s, the lead and oil industry mobilized public relations firms and scientific and medical consultants to lambast Needleman’s research and his credibility”.This actually happened. However, note that it IS the lead and oil industry which is at fault here. It is totally appropriate to protest the actions of big business here. However, the scientific method still prevailed. This has nothing to do with vaccine safety, one of the central arguments of this book. Needleman stuck to the scientific method. Judy Mikovits did not.Kindle pg 17: “Dr Morris irked his superiors by arguing that the research carried out by his unit demonstrated there was no reliable proof that flu vaccines were effective in preventing influenza”.The biggest reason that flu vaccines are not as effective as the other vaccines is that the flu virus keeps on changing. The analogy is that if you are trying to give your body a chance to fight a practice infection, the fighting is easy if the practice infection is the same as the real infection. If a virus with a different coat comes along, your immune system needs to regroup to fight the new enemy.Kindle pg 31: “The findings dovetailed with parental reports of autistic regression after a vaccination”.A true scientist would have also read: Denmark looked at over 650 000 children and tried to relate MMR vaccines with autism. They found no link. This data was out before the book was published.Kindle pg 35: “The revolutionary is shouted down for their new ideas”.Nope – science literacy demands that creative hypotheses be tested rigorously. It also demands that the research be repeatable. The only people who are shouted down are those who claim to be scientists and also simultaneously refuse to follow the scientific method.“masks will “activate” the virus and reinfect a mask-wearer over and over. “Viruses are quite fragile outside the body. They can break up because they have nothing to infect. Dry air and plain masks will destroy a virus if left there long enough. If you are infected once with a virus, you can’t get reinfected by the same virus over and over again. You should try to avoid contamination with a mask - if you constantly touch and retouch your mask during the pandemic without proper hand hygiene, you are likely to transmit a virus stuck on the mask to yourself or others.Kindle page 149: “XMR was poised to be much bigger than HIV”.XMR virus was later found to be an accidentally created virus in the laboratory. HIV is substantially bigger.Kindle page 291: “Among the first approaches we might try for any patient we suspect to be suffering from acquired immune dysfunction… is something called deuterium-depleted water”.Deuterium is another type of hydrogen that has one proton and one neutron. It is not radioactive. Guess what? This stuff occurs naturally everywhere, including your own body. You are born with the stuff and drink it every day. It is similar to regular water, except the hydrogen atoms are heavier than in regular water. As a result of the increased weight, it is a little more sticky than regular water, and you can hurt yourself if you drink the pure stuff day in and day out. Pure deuterium is super expensive and only found in research labs. Don’t worry about buying special water that is thousands of times more expensive than what you can get out of your home faucet. People are making money off of this, and you don’t need to be taken advantage of. It’s a waste of money.Bottom line – while her intention is to fight unethical top leadership, Judy Mikovits has strayed so far from the scientific method that she has completely lost credibility. Just a little bit of science literacy from the American public will allow anyone to see through the messages that this book is portraying. Fighting unethical top leadership is fantastic - but the method used in this book is tangential and illogical. Remember – when anyone tries to sell you stuff, including this author, ask how it works. Be curious. Ask for how the conclusions were derived. You don’t have to be a scientist – that’s the great thing about science literacy. The other great thing is that you don’t need to spend any money at all to be curious and ask questions – and then make simple experiments that help you confirm or deny your thoughts. Science only requires that you are motivated enough to uphold logical thinking and the scientific method. Uphold science literacy – and you will live in the amazing security of knowing that nobody can deceive you or take advantage of you.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3219QVMM95NO2","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2020","date":{"date":"July 19, 2020","unix":1595116800},"name":"Donna Moore","rating":5,"title":"Essential reading if you are concerned with Public Health and Truth.","review":"This book was easy to read.

My questions started getting more hardball: “If the earth is hurtling through space, why don’t we fly off?” My thesis advisor’s face would just turn red as he sat in stunned silence.As my questioning grew more aggressive, my advisor threatened to kick me out of the program, and I pinned him down: “Have you, personally, been into space to see the shape of the earth?” He just buried his face in his hands, wept quietly, and mumbled something about having failed as a professor and wasted his life.

One cannot help but wonder; How much change will it bring to our world? The human race time and time again has innovated and created newer and more cutting-edge technology. As AI continues to mature, we may again witness another revolutionary jump of civilization. However, to what extent are we altering the world. That’s what this book is trying to tell us. It presents us with another reality with eye opening description and tech details. It enlightens us with the very real possibility of the dark aspects of AI, especially when it falls to the wrong hands.“Dr. Evil '' does not just live in the movie. It’s chilling to realize what this book describes is just another not sci-fi movie. As I read this book, in the back of my head I could not help but recall fictions such as “The matrix,” “The terminator,” “The minority report,” “The island,” and much more. We often celebrate the convenience and the benefits the technology brings to our lives, hence we fail to realize that technology does not abide by ethics and a moral code. Therefore, we foolishly underestimate the dangers that such tech could bring upon mankind. This book is a must-read for government officials, for engineers, and for ordinary people who are interested in AI and cutting-edge technology. For the casual reader, there is no worries with the complexation of vocabulary and complex words. Simply, it is not for curiosity and entertainment, rather, it is for the sake of our lives. We are not just playing with another harmless innovation. Malevolent governments and individuals could easily control the general public.

The pictures don't add any value or explanation to the text so all it does is really drive the cost up. It is also rife with spelling and grammatical errors, the author is not a native english speaker but this book would have benefited from some proper editorial work. There are no page numbers so if someone wanted to cite this book they couldn't. Lastly, it makes a lot of grand claims but the only actual verifiable source it provides is the URL sources in regards to some of PR-China's human rights violations in organ harvesting and trafficking.As for the content, it seems mostly made up. There are themes that are true, China does steal technology, they are the leaders in crowd surveillance, and they certainly clamp down on dissenting voices and opinions at home and abroad. While I'm sure there are companies and countries attempting to get to this level of technology I don't think we're anywhere near the level as this book seems to think we are. The author cops out naming any specific companies so he doesn't harm them but with his claims of self driving cars kidnapping the drivers essentially it seems clear he just doesn't want to be sued for libel.If you want to believe that China is using smart phones and 5G to recode everyone worldwide into becoming socialist cyborgs with terminator like hunter killer robots and drones moving throughout the world to poison and kill dissidents and stop religion then this is the book for you. This seems like fear mongering instead of a cautionary tale.On the plus side, because this book uses such a large font, lots of pictures, and blank space it's actually a very short read and can be done handily in one sitting.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1ZELRGKYE0JHH","asin":{"original":"B07WZ8ZSRN","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2020","date":{"date":"September 15, 2020","unix":1600128000},"name":"Insider","rating":5,"title":"Misused Technology","review":"Mr. Parsa has done a very good job in warning us about the dangers of current technology in the hands of the negative Elite (there are positive Elite, too), and he goes to some length to explain what AI is and how it works... but unfortunately, he explains it in somewhat abstract terms...

Seems more like a possible scientific dictatorship in the future. Personally, I’ve been interested in learning more about how these forms of AI may impact humans for quite some time so I’m glad I read this book!Additionally, some of the book’s content may be considered SciFi and/or futuristic. However, most of these technologies exists today! I still have a number of questions. For instance, what will become of humanity if we go down this unknown road of AI and technology? Will we have any morals, values, or beliefs if we emerge into this chaos? What will be the laws if we change ourselves completely? What about cancer cells and other potential medical issues that can be caused by prolonged exposures to viruses, radiation, and vaccines?Much of what the author explained throughout this book can actually be viewed quite possible nowadays, and yes, it’s very terrifying to know that AI can be weaponized as covert operations. Sadly, hardly any one would realize if they’ve been hacked or targeted, which can make this quite frightening if this happens to us.Perhaps, smart cities are not too far fetched from reality, or even VR for that matter, lol. Though, I am still curious if quantum mechanics plays a role in creating this environment. Maybe quantum computers can play a part. I dunno. There seems to be just an awful lot to learn about this topic to fully understand it more.Personally, I would like to learn a bit more about how these bio-digital aspects actually come into existence, and how you can make the distinction if it’s present or not. Consequently, some of these concepts appear to be complex.

Maresca","rating":5,"title":"A Fascinating Book","review":"The author's main point is that vaccines canprecipitate toxic overloads, inflammation andother unintended side effects which can be moredangerous than the disease to be prevented.Vaccines are said to contain dangerous ingredientslike formaldehyde, anti-freeze agents and antibodies.In addition, vaccines can cause genetic switches togo on or off, according to the author.These findings beg for the need to considerreplacing vaccine additives which are inorganicallybased with ones that derive from natural substanceswhich are organically based.The author points out that vaccinated childrenhave more asthma,allergies, ear infections, apnea,tonsillitis and hyperactivity. Interestingly,aboriginals cut their skin and expose it to dirtto acquire a natural immunity against dangerous toxins.And so, what does a parent do if a child isn'tvaccinated? The author doesn't make this clear.In my own experience, check with a practitionerof Alternative or Complementary Medicine.There is a National Center for Complementaryor Alternative Medicine of theNational Institutes of Health. Due to the plethoraof non-conventional medicinal protocols,the NIH has created a National Center forComplementary or Alternative Medicine to advisepatients.In this reviewer's experience, there are importanthealth tonics which benefit children like acidophiluswhich promotes good bacteria, Vitamin C, Quercitinand other antioxidants. These are potential alternativesto vaccination if parents listen to the author and don'tvaccinate their children due to the inorganic additives.The author provides advice on what to take afterutilizing antibiotic drugs. \"If you do choose to employantibiotic drugs, bear in mind that they interfere withnormal digestion by killing off beneficial colon bacteria.These are the very bacteria that make vitamin K,the B-vitamins cobalamin and biotin, help us digestmany plant and dairy foods, strengthen the immunesystem, and repress the overgrowth of pathogenicmicroorganisms.After antibiotic therapy, all persons should take yogurtand an acidophillus supplement for a month or two tohelp restore a normal, healthy bowel environment.I have found shamefully few doctors who tellthis to their patients, said the author. \"1)Reduced incidence of necrotizing enterocolitisassociated with enteral administration ofLactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteriuminfantis to neonates in an intensive care unit.Hoyos AB.2)A child born with virtually no immune system receivesvaccines loaded with toxins . The result can triggerdisease processes that are far worse than the illnessto be prevented by the vaccine, according to the author.The author points out that there are lower infectionrates due to improved sanitation, nutrition andliving conditions- not vaccinations per se.Another problem , according to the author,is that vaccine potency can be increasedvia adjuvants. These adjuvants increasepotency tremendously so that a much smalleramount of the vaccine can have the same orsimilar effect.\"Once this toxic sludge is injected directly into the blood,it will inevitably make its way into the brain, spleen,kidneys, liver, joint fluids, blood vessel walls,lymph vessels and connective tissues of intestines,lungs, breasts and other parts, according to the author.\"The author explains how large scale vaccinations inpoorer countries have had the unintended effect ofincreased infertility. On the other hand, snake venomhas been known to induce immunity against futurerattlesnake bites. The immunity is caused by thebody generating anti-serum to neutralize thetoxic effects of the snake venum. The achieved cellularimmunity protects the body against future exposure tothe same toxin.This is true unless the degree of exposure greatlyexceeds the bodily detoxification and compensationability . So, a carefully constructed vaccine canhave a beneficial outcome as demonstrated by the snakevenum application provided by the author. The readershould understand that vaccine protocolsaren't universally bad.Overall, the book mentions important implications forcurrent and future vaccination programs . There is a needto search for alternatives to vaccines loaded withtoxins and inorganic chemical combinations which couldconfound natural bodily processes. The author doesn'tprovide too much detail on viable vaccinationalternatives.The author also suggests a possible alteration ofDNA switching sequences. The presentation raises enoughquestions to revisit the scientific control group designwhich proves or disproves the efficacy of individualvaccination programs devoid of harmful side effectsor unintended health consequences.Patients should discuss the efficacy of individual vaccinesand alternatives with their personal physicians orhealth practitioner(s) in the experience of the reviewer .Always ask the health practitioner for a list of ingredientsor additives for the vaccine you are considering.This information should be readilyavailable to all patients. Discuss practicalalternatives and contraindications for any vaccineconsidered by you.Dr. Andreas Moritz is a practitioner of Ayurvedic Medicine.Ayurvedic medicine (also called Ayurveda) is one ofthe world's oldest medical systems.

It's a Survival Mechanism', 'Diabetes - No More,'Ending the AIDS Myth', 'Heal Yourself with Sunlight', 'Timeless Secrets of Health and Rejuvenation' among others. In VACCINE-NATION: POISONING THE POPULATION he offers his theories and studies about the history of the discovery of vaccines and how the populace has been sold a bill of goods that he does not feel lives up to the package insert.Many people follow Moritz arduously: there are enough people who have had bad results form modern medicine to support his manner of thinking.There are many people who feel his books are angry diatribes against doctors and pharmacology companies that try to prove that all things such as vaccines are pushed onto the public solely for the sake of making money. The reality is somewhere in the middle and to dismiss or disparage a man who has the courage to raise the doubts and questions Moritz raises deserves attention, even if the reader doesn't agree with him.Moritz' style of presentation, to this reader, diminishes his credibility. He writes 'The virus myth is a convenient too to control people.THIS is a basic truth.The only real antidote to the wily games politicians and vaccine-makers play is to educate your self and stop playing victim in this deadly power game.'He goes on to explain in his offense on vaccines the following statements: 'Vaccines, not viruses, cause disease. Viruses induce healing; they are not our enemies but are on our side. The 2009 swine flu outbreak is a genetically engineered, man-made virus. AIDS was introduced to Africa so that the West could reap huge economic profits form that continent's abundant natural resources.Many vaccines are genetically engineered to actually cause disease so the 'preventive cures' can then be invented to save vast populations form these 'killer diseases'. The 'scientific truth' - that germs cause disease - and on which modern health care policies are based, is nothing but a myth.Vaccines have crippling side effects which include autoimmune disorders, sudden infant death syndrome and autism.'The major premise of this writing is to prove that vaccines have never actually eradicated infectious diseases and that vaccines are simply a ploy by Big Pharma to gain wealth. Whether the reader elects to believe Andreas Moritz or not will likely be related to an individual's personal experiences with medicine.It is always healthy to know the full picture of any argument.

As a result of continued improvements in the collection of data on Indigenous status, this second report is considerably more comprehensive, with data available from more jurisdictions, and more detailed presentation, including time trends and vaccination coverage by jurisdiction. Vaccination coverage data provide evidence of successful program delivery and highlight some areas for improvement. For universally funded vaccines in children, coverage is similar in Indigenous and non-Indigenous children by 24 months of age. However, delayed vaccination is more common in Indigenous children, with 6%-8% fewer children fully vaccinated at 12 months of age. More timely vaccination, particularly within the first six months of life, is particularly important in reducing the disproportionate burdens of disease due to pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). For vaccination programs targeted specifically at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and adults, coverage is substantially lower than for those programs targeted at all Australians. This is true for hepatitis A and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine for children, and influenza and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine for adults. Targeted vaccination programs present a particular challenge for health services in urban areas. Nevertheless, the impact of vaccination programs in preventing disease and reducing the disparity of disease burden between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous people has been substantial. This is evident in data on notifications, hospitalisations and deaths. Diseases which, in the past, have had devastating and often disproportionately high impact on Indigenous people, such as diphtheria, measles, poliomyelitis, smallpox and tetanus, are now completely or almost completely absent from Australia. Hepatitis B infection, another disease responsible for high levels of infection and substantial serious illness and death in the pre-vaccine era, is also now well controlled in age groups eligible for vaccination. Although invasive Hib disease is now rare in Australia since the introduction of vaccination in 1993, higher rates of disease persist in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. More research is needed into the contribution of environmental factors, delayed vaccination and vaccine failure to this continued disparity. Hepatitis A has disproportionately affected Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in the past. Vaccination programs in north Queensland and in various other countries have been very successful in reducing the burden of hepatitis A. It is too early to assess the impact of the vaccination program for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children that commenced in regions outside north Queensland in November 2005. For some other diseases the situation is more complicated. The substantial impact of the national meningococcal C vaccination program since 2003 is evident in this report, although the higher proportion of non-vaccine preventable serotype B disease in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people underlines the need for a new vaccine to cover this serotype. Pneumonia remains the most important communicable disease contributor to premature mortality in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of all ages. In young Indigenous adults, the eightfold higher rate of hospitalisation compared with their non-Indigenous peers, and the 11-fold higher rate of invasive pneumococcal disease, suggest the need for more widespread use of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines in this age group. Current coverage for Indigenous 15-49 year olds, where influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are funded only for those with risk factors, is low even though some 70% of this age group have one or more risk factors. Overall, the data presented in this report provide powerful evidence for the impact of vaccines in reducing disease in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and also point to areas for further improvement. Immunisation programs are an example of how preventive health programs in general can be enhanced to close the gap in morbidity and mortality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3QUYNMCGJNA33","asin":{"original":"0984595422","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2013","date":{"date":"June 26, 2013","unix":1372204800},"name":"Rev.

Clearly, Mr. Moritz is a skeptic of modern medicine. In fact, his devotion to skepticism is almost laudable. It is rare to see someone so devoted to their own viewpoint, and so self-blinding that they are willing to throw away centuries of medical research in order to come to their pre-made conclusions. Mr. Moritz decides quite early in his book that germ theory as a whole is wrong. Let me restate this. He completely ignores all germ theory, calling it into question. This is not the first questionable decision he makes, however. He asserts that sickness is good, and that it is a way in which the body gets rid of negative elements of itself, and when a disease causes the death of someone, there was simply to much negative to get rid of. The only trait even somewhat decent I could find in Mr. Moritz was his incredible amount of faith. A faith not in a god or a researcher or a government, or even his compatriots work. A faith in himself, and his own beliefs. Citations were few and far between. This does not come as a surprise as one reads this books. His 'science' is based of flimsy excuses, and the belief that ALL research that does not clearly and explicitly support him is falsified data. I plead with you, do not buy this book, if only so that an 'author' such as Mr. Moritz does not have the finances to publish another collection of his personal, unsupported musings.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R23SGXW3UVYL6G","asin":{"original":"0984595422","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2016","date":{"date":"January 15, 2016","unix":1452819600},"name":"Alex Fezz","rating":4,"title":"Good for people who believe in natural medication and have questions over vaccines, lacks sufficient footnotes and references","review":"I have read many books on vaccines and it is a disgrace that we are not allowed to make out own choice as to what chemicals we pump into our bodies and those of our children.

Perhaps not, but still gets you comparing despite the illogic of it!","review":"Digital Library Loan e-bookI know a number of author’s by name even though I haven’t read any of their books.Stephen King for instance never hit my list of *must read* since I’m not a big horror seeker.A few others I’ve just never “gotten around to it”, so this is the first time I have read any of Dean Koontz’s books.While I know who the author is, I mean not knowing Koontz would be like not knowing about the moon.I mean I know it’s there, but it’s not like I’ve taken a rocket ship out for a visit.I’ve never really had the inclination to read any of his works.The reading of this particular book was inspired by the current Covid-19 Pandemic where there was a suggestion that the Author somehow predicted the future all the way from 1981.I definitely wasn’t reading any of his works in 1981! Haha.Out of curiosity and to see the supposed tie-in I decided I would put it on my list…how popular is this book?I put a borrow hold on my digital library in April and only just was able to borrow it at the end of September.When I returned the book, it automatically showed the wait time to borrow as 22 weeks!Apparently, conspiracy theories and future predictions from the past are trending!Or maybe people have too much time on their hands!I give it four stars as I did like Koontz’s writing style, and now that I’ve finished this one will be looking to read some of his other books.On the other hand, I wasn’t expecting the ‘supernatural’ element.Koontz really did a great job of drawing the reader in without all the lag and drag you sometimes have to muddle through to get to the meat of the story.I really enjoy books where the author knows how to do the set-up and develop the characters without the tedium of boring the reader to sleep until they actually make it to the plot.So, did Koontz predict the future all the way back in 1981? … it is creepily weird and eerie how similar some things are, though you do have to read more than three-quarters of the book to see that.It does make you wonder about somethings and in general, what the government doesn’t want you to know…yep, conspiracy theories may exist, but there’s usually a reason for that!Now, about that supernatural element; eh, it kind of hurt the story for me (though I’m sure some others would enjoy it). However, at the same time, if that element were removed it would probably be challenging to get the main characters from point ‘A’ to point ‘B’. I think it could be done, but who am I to question an author that knows how to spin a good tale.Without giving spoilers, I will say that even for a ‘supernatural’ set-up some of the things that occurred were a bit out of alignment with the condition of the person performing them.Overall, a good read that is well written.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R2Z22WC2ZFLV68","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2020","date":{"date":"September 30, 2020","unix":1601424000},"name":"Migdalia Padilla","rating":1,"title":"Wrong book!","review":"Wrong book not about pandemic it’s about a boy named Danny","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3JJJV6YTXKL3A","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2020","date":{"date":"September 23, 2020","unix":1600819200},"name":"DONALD W","rating":5,"title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RJX4OHCUOWXS6","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2020","date":{"date":"September 5, 2020","unix":1599264000},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"title":"Great","review":"Myself I like ke to read!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1AHJW1DPHDGEI","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020","date":{"date":"September 4, 2020","unix":1599177600},"name":"NonieBell","rating":3,"title":"Its good","review":"its good not great seemed to carry the same narrative to long sorry it made me feel like I wanted more to look forward to in the ending in the whole book its self really , I hate giving bad reviews but it might be some one else's type of book.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3C8OM2DI37MA0","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020","date":{"date":"September 4, 2020","unix":1599177600},"name":"Patricia Adkins","rating":5,"title":"Extraordinary read","review":"Book was great, but I expect great when it comes to Dean Koontz!!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2J4TQ5RFCFG4D","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2020","date":{"date":"September 2, 2020","unix":1599004800},"name":"PMC","rating":2,"title":"Trite","review":"Just another ridiculous yarn, trite.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1YOXB7DOZ63GJ","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2020","date":{"date":"August 30, 2020","unix":1598745600},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"title":"What you want to read.","review":"A read.

Those three are \"Funhouse\", \" Whispers\", and now \"The Eyes of Darkness\".I did not really care for either of the previous two novels.They are different than this one as they involved more savage criminality and more abject darkness.This novel is more of a science fiction / thriller novel, and although at times dark, there are also moments of lightness and some romance.I do need to mention that this novel was called to my attention at this time, due to the mention within it of a virus, (Not THE Virus), and a particular location, Wuhan, in China.I found that that is only an incremental part of this story and although a strange, and even amazing coincidence, not really what the story is about.I have an aversion to writing anything to spoil anyone's reading experience.I only state this in case one wishes to read this story at this time for that reason.I am only beginning to study Dean Koontz novels.This is easily my favorite thus far.I can sense his maturation as an author.Except for the purposes of comparing and contrasting, I consider the previous two that I have read to be forgettable.I am glad to have found a Dean Koontz novel that I actually liked as he was born and raised in my home state of Pennsylvania and I enjoy studying authors from Pennsylvania.Thank You...","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1GWRSZM3H9SQM","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2020","date":{"date":"March 15, 2020","unix":1584234000},"name":"P.

I enjoyed the book the second time around. I had either forgotten some of the plot points or confabulated them with other books I have read, not a difficult thing to do when you read a lot.I really like how one event can seem to be two different things, depending on how you look at them. In this book, when Danny first tries to contact his mother, she is frightened and believes a bad person is trying to scare her. Later, when she realizes that the strangeness is coming from her son, she is happy although still a little nervous.When I first read the book, I didn't know it was a Koontz book. That's what pseudonyms are all about. But I do recognize the typical Koontz villain, the usually man who feels himself superior to everyone around him and that justifies his actions.As much as is possible, I have been looking for the trade paperback reissues of these older books because Dean has added an afterward about the book. He may talk about why he picked the name he wrote it under, if it wasn't his own. In this volume he talked about a made for television series that this book was supposed to be part of. The story about how that didn't happen if very funny.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R13FUUKAZ04Q85","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2019","date":{"date":"May 25, 2019","unix":1558742400},"name":"Smk043087","rating":5,"title":"Great","review":"My favorite author ever","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R32NQSEU5OO4RG","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2019","date":{"date":"April 27, 2019","unix":1556323200},"name":"Jennifer","rating":5,"title":"Thrilling","review":"Dean u never seize to amaze me .

Then, why don't we retract that stipulation, given that the author has seen fit to resurrect the book, give it some half-hearted refurbishing, and have it re-published under his now-famous, surefire best-seller-bait name. Dean Koontz has done this with several of his early efforts, each update presumably taking about a half hour in an afternoon, sometime during the two weeks or so it takes him to create a legitimately new masterwork.Well, maybe that's all too negative. To be honest, I read The Eyes of Darkness in one day and was kept fairly well absorbed, although neither the story nor the characters could arouse in me the slightest emotional involvement. And it was strangely comforting, that there was no surprise or twist that felt even slightly unexpected or fresh. And it didn't really bother me that the only funny lines were the ones that weren't meant to be, or that the stabs at humor fall flat; quipping banter is usually how Koontz characters show affection for each other, and it's always a toss-up whether the effect is more phony or embarrassing; usually it's a draw.In his afterword, Koontz describes the book as \"a cross-genre novel mixing action, suspense, romance, and a touch of the paranormal.\" I have no serious quibble with this summary, even if the suspense didn't give me much of a tingle, and the romance was mostly squirm-inducing. At any rate, when you cross that many genres, successfully or not, there isn't much room--in the literal sense--for character development or a naturally unfolding plot; a combination of even two on that list would prove a strain. To keep things moving, people have to figure things out quicker than anyone could in life, keep the reader up to speed (either by completely non-naturalistic conversation with another character, or equally artificial inner thoughts), react and move without any hesitations or mistakes (other than those carefully calculated and factored in by the author)and, overall, to act like no human being ever would in a human world. These telescoped jump-cuts that advance the plot start to make the book seem like a comic book written by Rod Serling, audio version to feature William Shatner. The breathless climax is fittingly and utterly berserk, with a mother on the trail of her long-lost, presumed dead child, generously pausing in her desperation to allow for explanatory back story dialogue with the bad guys, and then, after the heart reanding reunion, some unlikely and rather risky dawdling featuring startlingly childish philosphizing along the lines of, \"But if our country does these terrible things to fight our enemies, don't we become JUST LIKE THEM??\" Well, not if our heroes have anything to say about it, you'll be happy to know. The ending is kind of puzzling, I have to say; a carelessly rushed end for the bad guys, a quick hug and a pensive, reflection, but no wrap up or what-happened-next. That kind of abrupt finish can have an eerie, mysterious effect if it's intended and effectively rendered; in this case, it seems more like Mr. Koontz realized he'd reached the end of his ream of paper and it was too late to go out for more.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1TAT4MQ60MH5S","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2011","date":{"date":"December 17, 2011","unix":1324083600},"name":"tomfromboston","rating":4,"title":"What a pleasant surprise from Koontz","review":"The Eyes of Darkness (TEOD) is a revamped version of a much earlier book by Koontz, writing under the pseudonym Leigh Nichols, from 1981. I was still in high school and had never heard of the book, nor Leigh Nichols, nor Dean Koontz. It was 1987 when I discovered Watchers and scrambled to find anything he had written previously. Like many others, I also became a fan. According to TEOD's afterward, this is the last of five books he has reissued (writing under the Nichols' name) that has been updated and slightly edited to be more relevant in the 21st century.TEOD is an utter treat. While a few areas stumbled here and there, the narrative, protagonists, antagonists, the minor characters, settings, dialogue, were all interesting without being overly wordy. This was the Koontz I remembered from 1987 onward. Not the current dreck he seems to spit out about twice a year. I found paragraphs in TEOD that ranged from 2 sentences to a whole page, with descriptions of everything from the cold, short winter days to the smells of a small-town diner to the evergreens on a snow-capped mountaintop. You actually felt like you stepped into the world his imagination had created for you.And while TEOD's plot involved a cold war-era meme reminiscent of the '70s and passed on into the early '80s, he was able to update the book to make it seem more relevant for today's times. You could feel the mother's anguish, confusion, and eventual anger: She was the Ripley from Aliens before we had a Ripley from Aliens.But don't let the cold-war sub-plot put you off. Koontz ties up that theme where it's within one's reach of believability. Just imagine the feeling you get when you watch a 007 movie from the early '80s and giggle over how silly those plots were (compared to the recent Bond films with Daniel Craig). TEOD might give you that feeling of déjà vu, sans the chuckling.Even though I know how his other book, Strangers, ends as well as the underlying plot, reading TEOD made me want to go out and find a used version of that book, or maybe Lightning, or The Bad Place. That's the other déjà vu you get. Wow, what a great writer Koontz was. The last book I read by him before TEOD was What the Night Knows: A Novel. Though not reviewed yet by me, I'd give that one 2.5 stars. It's probably one of the few books in the last decade that I enjoyed, until it went off the rails and into the supernatural. The closest Koontz comes to the supernatural are his Odd Thomas books, a blatant knockoff of The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series), in my humble opinion.I also just finished another re-issue of an earlier book, The Voice of the Night, he wrote under another pen name in 1979 that was pure simplicity and sheer joy. Like TEOD, there was no preaching, no wearing one's faith on one's sleeve, no pandering to the reader, no silly dialogue just for the sake of having dialogue. Everything had a purpose, every sentence had a meaning, every character relatable, and when not, their actions understandable.I give TEOD 4.5 stars but Amazon doesn't do half stars for some reason. I highly recommend this book. It's a classic Koontz thriller and you won't be disappointed.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RC7WD4KK2T5B8","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2011","date":{"date":"October 19, 2011","unix":1318982400},"name":"hccelie","rating":4,"title":"First Koontz and definitely NOT my last!","review":"This is my first book by Dean Koontz and I will most definitely be reading more by him.

I confess that I thoroughly enjoyed this thriller with paranormal overtones. It is definitely a guilty pleasure, and I read it in one sitting. It is a book that definitely keeps the reader turning the pages.Tina Evans is a former Vegas showgirl, who is now producing extravaganzas for Vegas Hotels. Divorced from her husband, a Vegas casino card dealer, she is still mourning the death of Danny, her twelve year old son who died in a terrible accident while out on a Boy Scout trip in the Sierra Mountains. Apparently, the bus that was transporting the scouts drove off the mountain side. So horrific were Danny's injuries, that she never saw his remains.Suddenly, just as she thinks that she may be starting to heal from her grief, the wounds are opened again, when she begins to get messages that are appearing seemingly of their own volition, advising that someone is not dead yet and is pleading for help. She eventually comes to believe that it is her son Danny.When she meets a good looking lawyer by the name of Eric Stryker, she asks him to assist her in getting an exhumation order, as she feels that perhaps if she sees Danny's remains, she may get over the feeling that she has that Danny is alive. Eric agrees, but no sooner does he apply to a judge for such an order, that all hell breaks loose. Suddenly, people are out to kill both Eric and Tina.Tina is now convinced that Danny is alive and that he is trying to let her know and lead her to him. Despite the odds, Tina and Eric make their way through the High Sierra Mountains to do just that, guided only by a mother's belief that her son is alive.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R35YHOVOBP52IT","asin":{"original":"B01K95N38G","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2010","date":{"date":"August 5, 2010","unix":1280966400},"name":"ladybugz820","rating":3,"title":"Was hoping for more...","review":"2.5 StarsWhile I feel like this book started pretty strong, I was disappointed with how it ended.

During the chapter he states \"the virus appeared to have a 25% attack rate...meaning for every person who had it, one out of four of their contacts would get it.\" When his son goes to a camp where an outbreak occurs he uses the justification \"the camp environment was similar to health care centers and nursing homes\" for giving his son Tamiflu prophylactically and convinced 250 campers out of 380 to do the same. Tamiflu was a stockpiled drug in case of a massive outbreak and the CDC \"strongly recommended giving Tamiflu only to those who were seriously ill or their contacts who had chronic illness.\" Not only does he blatantly disregard the \"logic\" when it comes to his own son, he uses evidence to say his suggestion worked but his math is slightly biased. For example, with 380 campers, 95 campers should have tested positive. The totally number of people who tested positive were 76 and the camp instituted quarantining of sick campers on day one. How can he seriously justify Tamiflu being the cause of the decrease when other measures were taken? And it went from an infection rate of 1 in 4 to 1 in 5.This is the second book I have read of his. It does not given a ton of information regarding the virus itself but gives insight into different reactions. I like Dr. Siegel but I believe this book will be more insightful in three years when the pandemic is over and we people can actually do research on the response to the pandemic.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2E7R2JK1T51DB","asin":{"original":"B08F2T79JH","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","date":{"date":"November 12, 2020","unix":1605142800},"name":"jkilbo","rating":5,"title":"REC'D","review":"New Not Damaged","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RKDROLCCUYIXQ","asin":{"original":"B08F2T79JH","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2020","date":{"date":"October 30, 2020","unix":1604019600},"name":"T.

The coverage on the pandemics from 1918, 1957, 1968, 76 were building my hopes. Not loads of details but I learned some new things. The 2009 H1N1 event was better covered but still not as detailed as hoped. Lots of Obama questions missed. Ebola in 2012 got limited coverage.The COVID coverage was then quite disappointing in lack of details. Lots of focus on Fear, not as much perhaps on the decisions and impacts on the timeline. Honestly the Conclusion was the best summary of the entire COVID topic. Well written.(Actually there is a lack of good editing from about Chapter 6 onward. Wrong words, missing letters, missing spaces between words. Very rushed to press.)Would I recommend this book? Maybe.

His book arrives at an important time in history, coincident with the detection by Zen Honeycutt of Moms Across America of glyphosate contamination in the vaccines. This ominous discovery unites the two groups through the realization that vaccines are a delivery system for toxic chemicals used in GMO-based agriculture.Brett Wilcox has a knack for presenting in easy-to-understand language the manipulative tactics used by the chemical industry to lead to irrational fears that serve to maintain vaccination compliance by the majority of the population. This quote from his book is a good example of his straight talk: \"Irrational fear of infectious disease + Irrational belief that vaccines safely prevent infectious disease = Vaccine compliance.\"If you're not one of the parents of a severely vaccine-injured child, it's easy to accept the belief system and stay in a comfort zone where you trust what your doctor says and does.

Wilcox is not afraid to target the corruption and deception in the medical/industrial/complex and their promotion of dangerous drugs and vaccines. According to the CDC, vaccines may contain many of the following excipients, adjuvants, or growth media: albumin, acetone (solvent), aluminum hydroxide, aluminum hydroxyphosphate, aluminum phosphate, aluminum potassium sulfate, amino acids, ammonium sulfate, amphotericin B, animal tissue or blood, ascorbic acid, bactopeptone, beta-propiolactone, benzethonium chloride, brilliant green, calcium carbonate, calcium calf (bovine) serum, chick embryo, chloride, chlortetracycline, cystine, dextran, diploid cells (aborted fetal tissue), DNA, Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid sodium (EDTA), fetal bovine serum, formaldehyde, formalin, gelatin, glucose, glutamine, and heaven only knows what else. People, especially those who claim to be Christian and discourage abortion, should think twice before considering the introduction of aborted fetal tissue into their or their children's bodies. In addition, as Wilcox points out, \"the CDC added the flu vaccine to the pediatric schedule in 2003 and that most flu vaccines still contain '50 micrograms of thimerosal…or approximately 25 micrograms of mercury' per dose.\" Thimerosal is ethyl-mercury, a developmental neurotoxin. If a healthcare worker dropped a vial of that vaccine on the floor, then he/she would have to vacate the building and call hazmat to come and clean up the hazardous material. Yet, the CDC maintains that it is perfectly fine to inject this hazardous waste into a person's body. The CDC is just another alphabet agency of the federal government that supports corporations. It does not exist to protect or provide any kind of protection to the consumer. Vaccines are designed to provide profits for big pharma. This book is very comprehensive. Wilcox talks about the sociopaths who are behind the production, promotion and marketing of vaccines. I have purchased this book as a paperback and in the Kindle edition.

It's experimental and some say dangerous. Now you want to know more about vaccines in general. This book will not disappoint.The autism epidemic puzzles you. Why is autism 1 in 50 now whereas it used to be 1 in 10,000? There was a rumor vaccines caused autism, but that was debunked, right? But wait, it has to have an environmental cause, because genetic diseases don't become an epidemic like that. What is the real story? This book will tell you.Why do so many kids have allergies nowadays, and asthma, and learning discorders? Why has the number of people with chronic diseases and auto-immune diseases gone up so much in recent years?Well, this book will explain a lot. This author has done amazing research, and has put together a well organized, footnoted, documented book, and he doesn't mince words.One thing I found very helpful is his comparison of vaccine ideology to a religion. People have faith in doctors, but doctors know little about vaccines except that they are told they are \"safe and effective\" in med school. They take it on faith that the CDC, the FDA and our government do adequate safety testing. But they don't. There are too many conflicts of interest and revolving doors between them, the pharmaceutical companies and the Rockefeller and Gates foundations.\"White coat priests\" at the CDC, NIH, and FDA have patents on vaccines, and make BIG money from them. So they keep adding vaccines to the schedule. Pharmaceutical companies aren't liable for any harm they cause, so they literally get away with murder.But shaking people's faith in vaccines, and by implication \"modern medicine,\" including their own personal doctors causes a sense of betrayal. So realize that you or others finding out this information may experience denial, anger, depression, and finally acceptance of these realities, but you will never have blind faith in \"modern medicine\" again.You are now vaccine informed, and I hope you will use this information to stop the harm these toxic drugs are doing to our society.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3F50NJ0OEASCB","asin":{"original":"1510752374","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2020","date":{"date":"December 9, 2020","unix":1607475600},"name":"Garconcanadien","rating":1,"title":"The author is profoundly misguided. How do I know? I'm a pediatrician who trains in vaccines.","review":"As a pediatrician, my goal is fairly straightforward. I want your children to avoid having to deal with the horrible consequences of vaccine preventable disease. I am well aware that most of the general public has not witnessed a vaccine preventable disease, or had to treat someone from it, so its totally understandable that some think pediatricians are trying to protect against risks that aren’t really significant. But our community as a whole, continues to see vaccine preventable disease.The biggest counterpoint that the readers of the review should consider is – there are literally millions of children around the world, who aren’t on Amazon writing about their vaccine injuries. Why would that be? Are millions of children engaging in the same conspiracy to hide vaccine injury from other millions of children? I would ask that you the reader, deeply ponder that scenario. Millions of children aren’t writing about their vaccine stories – because there literally is nothing to write about. A day of fever, sore shoulder, and then they forget about it. Are millions of children really coordinated enough to hide an international conspiracy?My team just had to take care of a rural child who was afflicted with actual tetanus – she was in such pain and breathing distress when she came in, that she had to be given a breathing tube to save her life. She spent over a month in the Intensive Care Unit, lost a lot of weight, and now needs rehabilitation to help her get back to her usual functional status.I just lost a patient to preventable liver cancer – and she became gradually more puffy. She had to deal with increasing full body pain. The cancer treatments themselves didn’t work. She gained more and more water weight. Then, she died at 26. I had a heart transplant patient die of EBV, a disease for which we don’t yet have a vaccine yet. There are many more stories from the world of Infectious Disease. If you want to hear them, just ask.Now, on to debunking the book itself. I am perfectly capable of debunking the entire book, but let’s take just some key phrases.Chapter 1: “Mothers and fathers are finding out too much to be intimidated by medical professionals who are unable or unwilling to provide informed consent”.I get that some of you out there feel deceived by a bad experience with a pediatrician, and of course, there are bad apples in every single profession. However, there’s no pediatrician I have met, or in my professional organization, the AAP, who strives to give bad informed consent. It is in fact, corporate pressure to see more patients in less time, that forces us to have less time with each individual patient. Some families want more detailed informed consent, and some want brief informed consent. If you are that family who wants to go all the way to the vaccine trials before you make a decision on vaccination, go for it. Just be aware that you might need more than one visit to discuss all that information. I would never try to withhold informed consent from you – you just have to say how much informed consent you want. If you want to discuss the ingredients – go for it. I started out as a biochemist.Chapter 1 – “The ever present evil of viruses and bacteria” – they are indeed ever present. They live everywhere. We don’t see vaccine preventable disease because of… you guessed it… vaccines. Genuine full blown vaccine preventable disease has one great example on Youtube – just search for Mayo clinic pertussis baby, and you can see what that disease looks like in one unfortunate patient.Chapter 4 “Vaccines are safe and effective… in social psychology, its propaganda”.This statement fails to take into account the overall safety profile of vaccines gathered over decades. Has vaccine science sometimes fell flat? Yes. Have vaccines sometimes had production errors? Absolutely. But it is hardwired into the scientific process to self-correct. If the entire scientific process was conducted by robots, perhaps we would all be batting 1000 when it comes to vaccine safety. But it is fundamentally conducted by humans. Research scientists actually love scrapping each other’s work. They love finding errors so that their star can rise and your star can fall. There are scientists who cheat – and guess what, we hate it when doctors and scientists do it, as much as members of the general public. Brett forgets to mention that. We make sure to kick the liars and cheaters out of medicine, as we did with Andrew Wakefield. The scientific process openly encourages peer review and revision of mistakes. Just because A occurred before B, doesn’t mean that A caused B. Just because my dog ran, doesn’t mean that it caused a foreign president to change his economic policy. We owe it to you and your family members to think logically.Chapter 11 “The government, medical establishment, and corporate-owned media all act out on the roles assigned to them by big Pharma”.If you would like for big business to act for free, you’ll have to find a way to change the entire Masters of Business Administration education system. They are taught to be loyal to profit from day one. If you know a way to fix that situation, actually many medical folks would like to listen to how you would do it. Medical doctors have the salaries that they do because they give up literally their entire 20s to medicine, where people with bachelors in other professions can easily earn six figures and get a head start on us. To reject big Pharma entirely, would mean to avoid the hospital when you have a car accident. To reject big Pharma entirely, would mean to avoid the hospital when you need emergency surgery. To reject big Pharma entirely, would mean allowing your child to die when she has heart failure because you reject medicines. This was actually a thing in the Medieval era – death rates from diseases we now consider to be preventable was atrocious by modern standards. Until someone finds a way to destroy the human emotion of greed – this will always be there. But the CDC has so many mechanisms to monitor vaccine side effects. The CDC and physician community wants to know if you’ve experienced a side effect, and help you walk through it. I’ve done it myself and helped a family walk through it. If you want to reject all modern medicine, to be consistent, you also should go to a naturopath if you break your bones and receive no pain medicine. Would you do that?I said my biggest counterpoint to Brett is the millions of children in receipt of vaccines that have nothing to write about, because they get over the shoulder pain and fever quickly. The second biggest counterpoint is to pay attention to Brett’s credentials – a philosophy and economics background. Would you ask someone who played Flight Simulator to fly your Airbus A350? Would you ask a carpenter who has never designed an office building before, to make your new office building? I wouldn’t do either of those things. I would seek out the person with the most training to give you advice on a question you don’t know about.In summary, the pediatrician’s motivation is simple – vaccine preventable disease isn’t entirely dead, and we all want you to be able to avoid the landmines of vaccine preventable disease. If someone has a vaccine associated reaction, of course we want to help you sort it out. You are more than welcome to ask if your local pediatrician has the ability to find these vaccine reactions – and if you aren’t happy with the safety net, just find the next pediatrician who will. Pediatricians get just as upset about vaccine reactions as parents do. But, as men and women who rely on evidence, we can’t just proclaim something is due to vaccines because we feel like it. If you take that line of thinking to its extreme, anybody can proclaim anything. But this is your health we’re talking about. Free speech is welcome in a democracy, but biochemistry accepts only solid evidence. We are obligated to think it through because we want the best for your baby, as much as you do. Even pediatricians know to get a second doc’s opinion before diagnosing their own children. Our minds are not robotic. If we had all the time in the world, all pediatricians would answer all your questions, all the time. But, in this we might be able to shake hands – we both hate the corporate pressure for more productivity and more earnings for the executives. Remember, there are so many more people living healthy lives thanks to vaccines. There are countless people who can go to a region of the world with Yellow Fever, and not get it. Reach for your local health authority (CDC, NHS) for your first port of call on vaccine science, or book vaccine consultations with your pediatrician. I am protected against all major vaccine preventable diseases – and I would love for you to have the exact same thing.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1BIV4GOJ26QGN","asin":{"original":"1510752374","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2020","date":{"date":"November 20, 2020","unix":1605834000},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":1,"title":"Such a heartbreaking story","review":"A book description that tells you nothing, followed by one blurb from a computer scientist and another from a veterinarian.Yep, you know what you're getting into with this one.The book is easy answers for the paranoid and ignorant.

Wilcox constantly compares pro-vaxxers to a religious cult. Those looking for a moderate view on vaccines should look elsewhere.I used to be \"semi-informed\" about vaccines.E.g., I knew the annual flu shot isn't effective (only ~1 in 50 benefits) and that a minority of people can have a severe adverse reaction and even die.But I still thought the (small) benefits outweighed the (unlikely) risks. However, Handley's \"How to End the Autism Epidemic\" changed my mind because it revealed the enormous deception in the autism-vaccine debate.The CDC and the mainstream media routinely proclaim that the autism-vaccine link has been thoroughly disproven by science- but the Handley book PROVES this isn't even remotely true.All such studies focus only on the MMR vaccine and/or thimerosal-NONE of the other vaccines or vaccine additives (e.g. aluminum) have been studied!Handley's book is the best book on the autism-vaccine link. But Jabbed is overall a much more comprehensive book on vaccine issues.Wilcox begins his book by describing 4 vaccine views:1) True believers have a near-religious faith that vaccines are safe and effective-period.2) The informed know that vaccines can result in severe adverse effects (e.g. autism) and even death.3) The true-believer \"sociopaths\" are oblivious to vaccination's harmful effects due to blind dogma.They commit sociopathic acts in order to promote the vaccine agenda.4) The informed sociopaths are fully aware of vaccine's negative effects but suppress the truth due to corruption and greed (e.g. just like Big Tobacco denied the smoking-cancer link for decades).#4 doesn't care about vaccine safety and isn't liable anyway due to the 1986 VAERS act and a 2011 Supreme Court ruling, which shields Big Pharma from vaccine lawsuits.Jabbed primarily deals with the 4th category, and provides ample accounts of their misdeeds.(The mainstream media suppresses the truth because they depend on Big Pharma for advertising revenue.)But Wilcox misses an important \"2.5\" category: vaccine proponents who are well aware of vaccine's adverse effects-but who truly believe vaccines save millions of lives and regard the negative effects as acceptable \"collateral damage\".2.5 condones 4 because 2.5 is terrified that vaccination rates would plummet if the truthcame out.So the CENTRAL issue is how many lives are really saved by vaccines?According to Wilcox, diseases like tuberculosis and smallpox were already well on the decline before vaccinations due to better sanitation, nutrition and living standards.Some contemporary doctors even wondered if it'd be possible to discern the impact of vaccines, because so many common diseases were already sharply declining on their own.Wilcox says vaccinations can't be responsible for the eradication of smallpox because only 10% of the population received the smallpox vaccine.Wilcox also says that paralytic polio declined in the 1950s- NOT because of the Salk vaccine- but due to the re-classification of \"polio\" (so that 90% of previous cases were no longer counted) and likely because of the phase-out of DDT spraying, which can cause paralysis as well.The other justification for mass vaccinations is \"herd immunity\" (the idea that 95% of the population must be immune to prevent the spread of disease).But Wilcox debunks that as well: most disease outbreaks (e.g. the well-publicized measles outbreaks at Disney) involve all-vaccinated people.Vaccines don't confer immunity for many people and vaccine immunity wears off so \"herd immunity\" esp. among adults is largely a myth.The current coronavirus pandemic is another data point in the debate.Tens of millions died during the 1918 Spanish Flu, but today in 2020, sanitation/nutrition/living standards are far better and so far fewer have died.Perhaps several 100k will die worldwide instead of the millions originally projected. (Note: global flu deaths are supposedly 300k-600k per year.)COVID-19 then is not unusual in terms of deaths but in terms of the high number of hospitalizations.Contrary to some public health officials, the COVID-19 pandemic will NOT end only when a vaccine is developed. (Any coronavirus vaccine will be ineffective like the flu shot- because vaccines like most drugs only benefit a few and viruses constantly mutate.) COVID-19 will end like the Spanish Flu did by simply becoming more benign with time (and because of the harsh reality that the most vulnerable will have already died.)COVID-19is unusually lethal only because it's new to the human population- having (apparently) jumped from bats into humans only recently.Pandemics are tragic but vaccines are false hope- they're not \"magic bullets\" and are nowhere near as effective as antibiotics.Bottom-line:Jabbed has numerous examples of vaccine industry corruption and medical hubris.Scientists barely understand the immune system and don't understand how vaccines really work (and don't work).The so-called vaccine \"experts\" are like children playing with fire.They assume too much from the little they know and only know just enough to be dangerous.The decline of infectious disease is due to better hygiene/nutrition/living standards, NOT vaccines.Better sanitation and nutrition has saved FAR more lives than all of the vaccines combined.So the \"collateral damage\" from vaccines has been all for NOTHING!The vaccine program will likely be remembered as the biggest failure of the \"modern medical industrial complex\".Future generations will snicker at us for the vaccine fiasco, just like we snicker at bloodletting, miasma (theory that disease is spread by bad smells) and flat-earthers* today.*The \"consensus\" always includes climate change-deniers in this category but CO2 hysteria is just as misinformed as pro-vaccine dogma.Read The \"Real Inconvenient Truth\" for a Jabbed-like critique of CO2 hysteria.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2NP1VN7BGOEJT","asin":{"original":"1510752374","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2020","date":{"date":"March 23, 2020","unix":1584925200},"name":"Dennis Gannon","rating":5,"title":"Vaccines are poison","review":"There are two types of people in the world, the sheep and the goats; or Christians and the non- Christians, or the elect and the reprobates, or the wheat and the chaff, or those with “eyes” and those that are “blind” (spiritually).Many times the goats do stupid things, like vaccination, which hurts other goats.Jesus advises in Matthew 15:14, “Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind.

And the claim that the Illuminati controls virtually everything, including Christianity, is bogus. I believe this is part of the deception. They want us to believe they have all power. When it comes to information about Christianity and Jesus, Marrs only repeats the worst kind of popular anti-christian polemics, thereby demonstrating either his ignorance or dishonesty. For example, he connects Jesus to the Essenes. There is no evidence they were connected. In his book, \"The Historical Jesus,\" Gary Habermas shows the many differences between Jesus and the Essenes. Marrs also claims that Essene information was removed from the Bible. There is no evidence this ever occurred. There is also no evidence that Jesus ever had children. Marrs seems to copy popular \"New Age\" literature like other authors who copy from each other, but nobody ever bothers to research to see if the claims are true. He also repeats the errors of Zecharia Sitchen on the Anunnaki. He claims it was the Romans and Greeks who gave the interpretation that they were gods. That's not true. The Sumerians considered them gods. Mike Heiser is a Hebrew and Semitic scholar and has a website dedicated to refuting the errors of Zecharia Sitchen. With that said, that does not mean everything in his book is wrong; at least when it comes to the Illuminati and secret societies. But even then, I'm not sure how accurate he is, since I am not an expert on secret societies. Marrs promotes the idea that aliens visited earth long ago. This error is debunked in the Youtube video, \"Ancient Aliens Debunked.\"","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3VWIS8WSAAY08","asin":{"original":"B06XGC6SNK","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2018","date":{"date":"January 21, 2018","unix":1516496400},"name":"CG Veach","rating":5,"title":"WHO'S running the government?","review":"VERY interesting and thought provoking !","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2CO8G15W8APFD","asin":{"original":"B06XGC6SNK","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2018","date":{"date":"January 7, 2018","unix":1515286800},"name":"Joealf","rating":5,"title":"recommended","review":"last book by jim marrs......recommended reading","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R112OGF3USS11N","asin":{"original":"B06XGC6SNK","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2018","date":{"date":"January 3, 2018","unix":1514941200},"name":"Lori H.","rating":5,"title":"Five Stars","review":"Daughter loved it!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2A9XURLKKTVED","asin":{"original":"B06XGC6SNK","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2017","date":{"date":"December 9, 2017","unix":1512781200},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"title":"A Must for the Conspiracy Buff!","review":"The Illuminati: The Secret Society Who Hijacked the World by Jim Marrs is a historical overview of the Illuminati, Freemasonry, and other secret societies.He methodically records the beginnings of Weishupt, the Illuminati's founder, and their rise in popularity along with their downfall within the public eye.He documents his beliefs on what happened to the group after they ruffled the feathers of Germany's elite.Marrs also includes other secret societies like the Rosicrucians, Club of Rome, Bohemian Grove, the Nazi Party, and many more.Marrs has written many works that have to do with conspiracy and the inner circle.This might have been his last book.He died last August.https://www.amazon.com/Illuminati-Secret-Society-Hijacked-World-ebook/dp/B06XGC6SNK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1512696883&sr=8-1&keywords=Jim+MarrsMy Review: I will always love the important work that Marrs has done in terms of research, publications, and getting the word out about the truth that many conspiracy theories hold.The Illuminati is no different than his other masterpieces.I knew quite a bit about the Illuminati before delving into this long book.As usual, once I finished the book, I knew much more.I loved how Marrs connected the dots between some of our most influential and suspicious families-Rothchilds, Rockefellers, Adams, and many more.He brought up the question of whether or not Weishupt was George Washington.He even mentioned the Jewish connection between Hitler's mother, a maid, who worked for a Rothchild, of course implying that Hitler himself is a descendant.I also loved the Bolshevik/Communist connections he made between Engels, Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky.He even mentioned the Iraq Museum and how the US government might have been in on the theft of ancient objects during the Gulf War.This book was loaded with information.It is a must read for conspiracy buffs and history lovers.RIP, Jim Marrs!You will be missed.5/5 Stars","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1QM1BEULM68DN","asin":{"original":"B06XGC6SNK","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2017","date":{"date":"November 19, 2017","unix":1511053200},"name":"Maria Stenger","rating":5,"title":"Well worth the read","review":"Fascinating, filled with details not found elsewhere.

This final book is where he shares many interesting things, especially in the Modern Illuminati section where he goes into Whistleblowers (pp 287-309) which reveals what is going on in today's world. (He did not use Chapter numbers in this book.) In addition, the Conclusions (pp 341- 348) section addresses the Deep State (that Hannity on FOX News always talks about), and recaps Chas Fort and the skygods. Lastly, he asks a very intriguing question, regarding the bloodlines and those who seek to control Earth: Are they even us [humans]?This question is better answered by TJ Hegland in his last book, The Great Earth Puzzle (see Appendix F), and by Joseph Farrell in his Covert Wars... (2 books) dealing with the Breakaway Civilization -- Jim deals with that too in Whistleblowers section (called Military Industrial Complex).Interestingly, JIm exposes the Luciferian Conspiracy and clarifies Lucifer, Adonay (pp 158-159) and the relation with the Anunnaki god Enki -- which Hegland more correctly identifies with Enlil (aka Yahweh in Virtual Earth Graduate).By denigrating Lucifer (and falsely equating him with Satan), Man winds up worshipping the wrong god.Adonay was a cruel god and Lucifer just means Bringer of Light.Do we have a certain Church to thank for skewing Man's understanding of the Truth? Jim thinks so and so does Hegland.On pp 18-19, Jim explores the issue with gravity, as does Hegland in The Great Earth Puzzle and reveals what Hegland said was true about Newton: he assumed and could not prove its existence. Newton was a Kabbalist and into Alchemy assuming that there were esotreric forces at work... Hegland deals with that in Appendix D and Chapter 4 -- you will never think of gravity the same way again, after Hegland's in-depth analysis.Jim also goes into Philip Gardiner's The Shining Ones, and throughouthis Illuminati book he identifies the shining ones... evidently Hegland and Marrs were on the same page when they wrote their last two books. (Note that Jim Marrs endorsed Hegland's Virtual Earth Graduate book, so the one knew about the other.)Illuminati is highly recommended and will give you plenty to reflect on.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RUQ2UE67ZK6EU","asin":{"original":"B06XGC6SNK","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2017","date":{"date":"September 8, 2017","unix":1504828800},"name":"Dwayne","rating":5,"title":"Jim Marrs Last Book.","review":"An excellent book by Jim Marrs as well as his last.I find it well documented and full of information put together by a master of investigative reporting.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1HS7CQVKO6TPQ","asin":{"original":"B06XGC6SNK","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2020","date":{"date":"October 26, 2020","unix":1603674000},"name":"Robyn L.","rating":2,"title":"Ilimianati","review":"Dry.

Sitchen exegesis.","review":"I’m a few hours into the audiobook and feel betrayed. These hours heavily borrow from Alien Sitchen dullards but are packages as if perplexing scholars, and/or scholars concur- that in the deepest epoch of pre history aliens “from the heavens to earth came” [para.], exclusively betraying the fraudulent Semitic translation of Sitchen.Yet, there seems to be a gravity about the packaging that will, I confess, cause me to listen further- though such a premise only leads to faulty conclusions. The author leans heavily upon Gardiner and Osborne’s excellent Shining Ones in the opening, but they never carried Sitchen’s water. Considering this begins his journey of unveiling Secret Societies, and no where are aliens mentioned in the write up selling this book, it’s thus a Bait & Switch- and deception is always the sign of inferior argument.The Serpent cosmology of Sumer is not, in any event, the starting point of this symbolism and cosmology. The author betrays this ignorance.

There have been studies about large droplet size vs. small droplet size in the transmission of viruses and spores. There have been contradictory advisories issued by our bureaucratic overlords at the CDC about the efficacy of mask wear.But then the government stepped in to impose an overlay of coercive demands about how we must behave; and that’s when the mask wearing took on the usual irrational politicization that we see every time a government agency inserts itself to control our behavior. We see distrust; we see the spread of absurd conspiracy theories; we see clusters of outrage; we see self-righteous defiance; we see public policy running amok.Combine this with the fact that as scientific understanding of virus transmission continued to “evolve,” we had to endure the confusion of small droplets vs large droplets; the confusion of masks that allow aerosols to pass through combined with the fact that droplets are far larger than aerosols; the confusion over the new distinction between “pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic” contagiousness.This whole mask debate is rooted in epistemological confusion, in misapprehension over what can properly be considered knowledge as compared to a mere assertion, or even to a partly true assertion.Alex Berenson tries to make the case that mask wear has been largely unhelpful in the pandemic management. But what he offers up as the weakest evidence for masks may actually be a very strong case for mask protection: “Just because I didn’t have an accident after driving drunk doesn’t mean doing so is safe.”Or – just because I didn’t get infected by being near people wearing masks doesn’t mean that the masks made any difference.I agree that there have been “insufferably arrogant pieces” published in the press; I agree that “follow the science” is a catch-phrase which can lead to support either side of a controversy; I agree that most of us wear masks without a good grasp of their impact on virus transmission.What are we to make of it when Berenson offers us this: “More of us are wearing masks more often than ever before. Yet the virus is spreading faster.” He takes that to be evidence that “masks don’t work.” But isn’t that on par with more and more of us driving drunk but not having accidents?The bottom line appears to be: “We shouldn’t drive while drunk.”","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R165MVAGZLOWYS","asin":{"original":"B08P3T15PW","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2020","date":{"date":"December 21, 2020","unix":1608512400},"name":"Kindle Customer","rating":5,"title":"Makes you think","review":"Another concise, we'll written booklet describing and questioning the current stateof affairs.Everyone should read this to understand the rationale behind mask use.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1QGBL92703Y4X","asin":{"original":"B08P3T15PW","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2020","date":{"date":"December 21, 2020","unix":1608512400},"name":"A.

Away!\" - from THE LONE RANGER western TV series of the 1950s featuring a masked Texas Ranger hero and his horse Silver\"Just 100 days to mask, not forever. 100 days. And I think we'll see a significant reduction\" - President-Elect Joe Biden“As a practical matter, if civilians are going to wear face coverings, they will be standard cloth or surgical masks. But the limitations of those masks were well documented long before the coronavirus epidemic.” – from PART 3: MASKS“The United States is not alone in seeing huge spikes in positive Covid tests despite mask mandates and high levels of mask use. Most of Europe has had the same trend.” – from PART 3: MASKS“As Anthony Fauci said in press conference in May [2020], … he wears masks ‘because I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that’s the kind of thing you should be doing’.” – from PART 3: MASKS“Of course, encouraging people to take actions that are (supposedly) symbolically valuable is different than forcing them.” – from PART 3: MASKSThis third installment of Alex Berenson’s pointed and maverick critique of America’s reaction and approach to the COVID-19 pandemic is, as the title indicates, a critical examination of masks – their efficacy and government mandates to wear.PART 3 was written after the 2020 election and at the start of the winter spikes of Covid now being experienced (including in my state of Washington after months of the governor’s insistence that we all wear masks - a plea that, by my observation, is being faithfully followed by the populace).The health experts’ approach to (cloth and surgical) mask wearing has evolved from not necessary, to necessary by the symptomatic Covid-afflicted to prevent infection of the unafflicted by the formers’ coughs and sneezes, to necessary by all for the prevention of virus transmission by the coughs and sneezes of those otherwise maskless asymptomatic carriers. Darn those sneaky asymptomatic carriers!Sadly, as Berenson takes great pains to emphasize, the supposed efficacy of cloth and surgical masks has been consistently undermined by studies of the size of the airborne droplets that carry virus particles – droplets that can and will, because of their minuteness, penetrate such masks.Social distancing would seem to be the better preventive measure of Covid transmission – a preventive undermined by government mandated lockdowns that force people to remain inside their homes (where they will stubbornly insist on gathering for social occasions such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the New Year).The reader is best left with the sobering thought worthy of any guv’mint black helicopter conspiracy theory:“… mask mandates appear to be an effort by governments to find out restrictions on their civil liberties people will accept on the thinnest possible evidence. They are the not-so-thin edge of the wedge.”But also remember the maxim: Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that they're not after you.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2M2XA2YG6BJNN","asin":{"original":"B08P3T15PW","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2020","date":{"date":"December 7, 2020","unix":1607302800},"name":"Kindle Customer","rating":5,"title":"A knowledgeable series","review":"In a country where our media does not value truth or fact, I value both.

In fact if the evidencial information provided in this book were taken further, you could surmise that mask mandates and the false security created with wearing masks could easily lead to more risk to spread. If people ignore more effective virus spread mitigation because they are wearing a mask, viral spread could explode. This may be why we are seeing more recent widespread outbreaks of Covid 19 even though mask mandates and increased usage of masks have been in place for months.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1EOWK7S6KV0KN","asin":{"original":"B08P3T15PW","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","date":{"date":"November 26, 2020","unix":1606352400},"name":"Carrie","rating":5,"title":"Worth considering","review":"Interesting perspective on the mask debate.Great read aloud for the kids on Thanksgiving.I’m considering sending a link to Governor Abbott and the director of my child’s school.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R2EX5AAOXPVZDM","asin":{"original":"B08P3T15PW","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","date":{"date":"November 26, 2020","unix":1606352400},"name":"Teresa","rating":5,"title":"Uncomfortable truth","review":"Very well written, easy to follow, well documented.

Masks haven't been proved to work. There are a number of old RCTs that showed an effect on flu and other respiratory viruses ranging from 5% to 95%, with a central tendency around half. None of these address our current situation of people walking around in the community with masks to prevent covid. They test masks in medical settings, or on non covid viruses,and other one off situations. Berenson does well to note that the one current, relevant RCT, the Danish mask study, did not find a statistically significant benefit from wearing a mask. It found around a 20% benefit, with a p value between .3 and .4. Ironically, this is almost exactly the same finding as the best RCT of hydroxychloroquine, published in NEJM. Both the authors and readers of the HCQ study concluded that the treatment didn't work, but the biased readers of the mask study conclude that the study was no good. The scientific interpretation of both studies is, \"maybe a modest benefit; a larger RCT needed.\" This is where Berenson goes wrong. He doesn't rest with saying that masks are unproved. He says \"they don't work.\" Most of his book focuses on barely relevant in vitro information about droplets and aerosols. The fact is, masks fog your glasses. That means some of your spew isn't getting out. So, it's likely covid transmission is reduced. What we don't know is, how much. If it is about 20%, and the other guy's mask reduces it another 20%, then masks are a useful addition to other social distancing measures.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1L8JUZ37BB38N","asin":{"original":"B08P3T15PW","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2020","date":{"date":"November 25, 2020","unix":1606266000},"name":"Will Gaston","rating":5,"title":"Good data - a good read","review":"And unfortunate that Amazon initially banned this little book, preventing it from being sold on this platform.

Everyone who listens to the government's top echelons at organizations like the CDC and NIAID and believes that these are credible scientists of integrity needs to read this book.

Fate has pushed Mikovits to center stage; she has literally become THE lynchpin for taking down this entire corrupt murderous house of cards.She's fearless and unstoppable.In short, she is a national treasure and ought to be treated accordingly.This is one of the most important books to be published in 2020 and should be on your list of must-reads (near the top, as time is short and no less than the future of this nation is at stake).Mikovits and Heckenlively have an earlier book, Plague, but this one is better written, better organized and easier to understand due to science terms being better explained than in their first book.For this reason, I recommend reading this book first and then move on to her first book to go more in depth.She also did a fantastic book called \"The Case Against Masks: Ten Reasons Why Mask Use Should be Limited\" which I purchased on Amazon but is not longer available (censored?).The book references loads of scientific studies and her views are corroborated by many other scientists.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RAMGFUDCAP37U","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2020","date":{"date":"November 6, 2020","unix":1604624400},"name":"Don Anderson","rating":5,"title":"Must Read","review":"The author goes into great detail into big pharma and our Federal Government corruption.This is a must read for all!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R26ESZASRZBA5R","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2020","date":{"date":"November 5, 2020","unix":1604538000},"name":"Maria","rating":5,"title":"EXCELLENT","review":"Great book.

From my other background as editor of many articles and books it seems it could use another round hence 4 stars.Nevertheless, the 19 stars I cannot award under Amazon’s system are wholly for courage, depth and passion in delivering a message whose time has come: if my understanding is clear, between the lines I read that the concept of vaccination is completely valid. Unfortunately, in its execution the medical establishment appears to choose a path of least resistance (which it defends tooth and nail) with undue regard for the lives of those that are harmed as a result, no matter how statistically small the numbers in their opinion.Both my parents have already passed away and they had me at was then an advanced age (mother was 36), but from what I remember of my childhood I used to be smart, alert and outgoing, yet I grew increasingly introvert, slow in thinking and intimidated by others as I received one childhood vaccination after another. I scored 24 points on a 50 point autism test where autism starts at 25 points. My girlfriend scored 9 points and she had no empathy for my challenges. That relationship didn’t last long.Judy describes for the first time in my life how I feel. I can’t imagine what it feels for those who have full blown autism. Where I wish her enthusiasm had been curbed a little to come across perhaps a bit more convincing, the authors make up for it by providing some extremely useful discussions on cellular functioning.The parts on HIV and its political journey are something I can relate to 100% - because I met two scientists from South Africa who devised a cure, helped countless yet were told by the post-Apartheid government to get lost. Black lives appear to not matter at all outside the USA in case you were wondering. Needless to say Henk and Mariëtte Van Wyk did leave their home country only to be told the same thing in the US as of the date of this writing.Some people seem to live in fear - as if they have a thousand years to live. Some people lie to others because of that fear. Others just practice self-deception and believe that what the liars say has to be true because the liars are in authority. Maybe we will only emerge into a new era of understanding when we identify the liars for good. In the meantime, Plague of Corruption seems to do a great job exposing the lie behind vaccination. If only it would have included an expose of what ingredients would contribute to a safe version of existing vaccines, and perhaps something more on why, however speculative, harmful and toxic ingredients may have been selected for inclusion, it would have been more perfect than it already is. Maybe that’s covered in the sequel.

Mikovits/Ruscetti also found a ~80% correlation between XMRVs and CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome).It's important to note that a CAUSAL relationship wasn't confirmed, only a correlation.Mikovits contends that top US public health officials (Fauci and Collins) forced her to retract her publication and ruined her career in order to \"protect\" the reputation of the US blood supply.She also says the US govt has quietly bought medical equipment, which Mikovits confirmed can eliminate XMRVs from the blood supply.The most disturbing part of this section are the several doctors and scientists who (allegedly) committed suicide. Mikovits questions if these were truly suicides but can't prove anything more sinister.The second half of the book discusses vaccine safety and Mikovits' belief that vaccines really are a causal factor in autism as well.She also says that vaccines impair the immune system overall and may be a factor in other conditions besides CFS and autism.I used to be pro-vaccine but reading \"How to End the Autism Epidemic\" changed my mind.So I'm mostly in agreement with Mikovits' critique of vaccines.However, I can only give this book 3 stars because it's poorly organized and rambling and overly speculative.My guess is that the book was \"written\" by transcribing conversations with the co-author.Mikovits has also attracted attention by speculating that SARS-COV-2 (the virus that supposedly causes COVID-19) only causes a severe illness in people who also have a XMRV.But this is unproven and COVID-19 is not mentioned in the book.Bottom-Line:If XMRVs do turn out to be an important factor in health, then this book will be remembered as a landmark work despite all of the flaws.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2GUG8YOROY3WE","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2020","date":{"date":"September 3, 2020","unix":1599091200},"name":"KD9EPX","rating":5,"title":"wonder how ur being lied to???","review":"50 working neurons and an open mind required... science illiterates need not apply..

Busse","rating":2,"title":"Controlled Oppo","review":"I was disappointed in this book, and I don't think the good doctor is being forthcoming. Like many, I discovered Dr. Mikovitz via the film Plandemic, but my view is that Plandemic was created as part of an elaborate campaign by the uniformed epidemiological intelligence service to control the flow of information from the CDC. In that regard, Mikovitz seems a classic propaganda tool: they put out a pseudo heroic whistleblower accompanied with a book, fill it full of juicy limited hangouts, and let the whole thing lead the public into a cul-da-sac.My first question is in regard to Mikovitz's arrest. I've been following the corrupt sheriff's dept. of Ventura County for quite some time, and Geoffry Dean is fully compromised - same with Sheriff Ayub. If you want to get a sense of the facility where Dr. Judy stayed, check out the Ventura County Sheriff \"Lip Sync Challenge\" video on YouTube. Mikovitz (who is a member of a hoity-toity country club north of Port Hueneme) spends a night in in a jail where the deputies sing \"staying alive\" while wiggling their hips and BOOM! She's a heroic suffering whistleblower. Balderdash.Next, Mikovitz has HIV/AIDS completely wrong. Her book coughs up the same tired hypothesis without even engaging with Peter Duesberg or Nobel Prize Winner Kary Mullis. This IN SPITE of the fact that Plandemic discusses Dr. Luc Montagnier - and deciphering his cryptic comments is really the key to a \"plague of corruption\" (and if you want to know the full history of Montagnier, I recommend John Cleushaw's \"Science Fictions\"). This is classic controlled oppo - because the epidemiological flaws of HIV and coronaviruses are so similar and so entertwined, by not discussing the flaws of the HIV hypotheisis at all, Dr. Judy diverts HER AUDIENCE from the trail - in other words, she gets the progressives off the case.And, let's be honest. Anybody who works at Ft. Detrick has a security clearance. Dr. Judy can spout off about XMRV all she want's but as a security cleared individual, she is tighly controlled and following orders.

She was intimidated, censored, slandered, subjected to surveillance, bankrupted, banned from her profession, and even falsely accused of crime leading to her being held in jail for five days. Worst of all, colleagues in a similar situation were found dead under mysterious circumstances.Is this a realistic account? Do people in high places in industry and government really behave like that? Yes, unfortunately, and not only in the U.S.Mikovits's unpopular research results led her to posit that a host of diseases including cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, autism, diabetes, early Alzheimer, Ebola, HIV (which is not a disease), and more are caused by retroviruses introduced into human bodies through vaccines. All vaccines, she reminds us, are cultivated on tissue from animals such as birds, cows, guinea pigs, horses, mice, and monkeys. Therefore they “break[...] down the barriers nature has erected so that pathogens of one species cannot be easily transferred to humanity and vice versa … one of the major problems with vaccines is that … we don't know what viruses and pathogens are coming back in the needle.” The exceptions are vaccines have been bred on tissue from aborted human fetuses. In addition they contain toxic chemicals such as “mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80 and a host of others.”Earlier I reviewed The Virus and the Vaccine which has a similar message. Then and now I have my doubts about viruses causing (some?) cancer, let alone CFS, diabetes, and Alzheimer. I'm not even fully persuaded viruses exist except in the original meaning of the word: an unknown cause of non-bacterial infectious disease. All the less do I trust the research on retroviruses which are Mikovits's specialty. I applaud that she echoes the criticism I levied in my review of The Virus and the Vaccine, namely that no proper study has been done comparing the lifespan disease history of vaccinated people with those who have never been vaccinated. In what other field of medicine would studies without control groups be acceptable? Without them, neither her claims nor the claims of those who vilify her have a leg to stand on.Mikovits reports having worked for Robert Gallo, either credited with discovering HIV or accused of falsely professing to have done so while actually stealing the glory from French researcher Luc Montagnier, who was rewarded a Nobel prize for it. Gallo has however not been passed up by prizes, as he is the only person to have been awarded two Lasker prizes, the most prestigious prize in US medicine. Mikovits gripes that Gallo “hogs all the credit” while the work was actually done by researchers like herself and her colleagues in his lab. Well, that's the way it is in life. The horse wins the race and the medal is pinned on the jockey. Mikovits boasts three times in the book that it is she who proposed -- “saving the lives of millions” -- that HIV-inhibitors should be prescribed as soon as the person tests positive rather than waiting until symptoms appear. Symptoms of what? AIDS is like schizophrenia. The definition keeps changing as conveniences the medical profession. She herself admits that “HIV does NOT CAUSE AIDSbecause a genetically resistant person can be infected with HIV and never develop AIDS” (caps in the original). So what is the wisdom of taking highly toxic drugs during an entire lifetime for a presumed disease that may never appear, not to mention the unreliability of the tests? Her unequivocal endorsement of the HIV-inhibitors without discussing their drawbacks starkly contrasts against her skeptical position on vaccines.This does not detract from the issue that vaccines are not necessarily safe. There is no such thing as a risk-free medical intervention. Mikovits deserves praise for drawing attention to the risks, even if she has overstated them. Vaccines by nature are administered to healthy people, including infants, with a lot to lose. Mikovits states “Every time the government investigates vaccines, they find problems and they make the decision to cover up the information.” Government propaganda about vaccine safety can be countered by looking at the reports of adverse reactions. In my little country every year one to four infants die as a result of routine vaccinations according to public adverse reaction records. Given the medical taboo for admitting iatrogenic death these incidents are no doubt vastly under-reported.On the other hand, the vaccine deaths must be weighed against the benefits for the vast majority who appear unharmed, namely the presumed prevention of serious illness. The only person who can legitimately do the weighing is the (parent of) the individual involved. MeTZelf does not oppose vaccinations but does oppose all governmental pressure, not to mention coercion, to vaccinate.Regarding the much publicized as well as refuted link between vaccines and autism, it simply happens too often to be ignored. I can't help but notice that medical professionals tend to brush off the possibility of such a link until their own child is affected (Andrew Wakefield, Jon Poling … the first is libeled and ruined, the second receives a $million+ settlement). Vaccinations are surely not the only cause of autism. I suspect it is one of many.On the side, Mikovits reveals an interesting theory regarding the history of what is now called the Americas. The inhabitants who were there already are reported to have had no immunity to the diseases brought by the European conquerors. The theory proposes that the reason Europeans carried so many diseases is because for many centuries they had lived in proximity to animals, mainly domesticated ones kept for food or as pets, but also mice and rats who thrive among humans. In other words, the crossover of viruses from animals to humans has always been a source of disease. She could have lent extra credence to this theory by pointing out that the exchange of diseases does not seem to have been reciprocal. The inhabitants already there did not seem to infect the Europeans with anything except -- according to some but by no means all authorities – syphilis, which is not a virus disease. This theory of disease by association with animals would be a convenient additional argument for vegans. However, it has little to do with what she calls the “cover up” of“lab-derived animal retroviruses.”Plague of Corruption has an excellent eleven-page foreword by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., president Kennedy's nephew.

There are so many points in this book that are skewed, biased, try to relate things that are completely unrelated, that the wider public needs to know that this entire book represents a failure of logical thinking. Think of this experiment: An alien contacts us, and has the interesting experience of witnessing a human becoming drunk. The alien confiscates the drink – it doesn’t know what a margarita is. It devises an experiment to determine if it is water or alcohol that makes humans drunk. The alien gathers together four humans, and asks one to drink beer, one to drink wine, one to drink Hennessy, and the fourth to drink Gin. The four drinks have two things in common – and that is water and alcohol. The alien happily concludes that water makes people drunk. Everybody would know that is the wrong conclusion. Here are just a few of the ridiculous points that Judy Mikovits makes.Kindle pg 10: “Mikovits’ evidence threatened financial catastrophe for the world’s pharmaceutical companies because of their negligent use of animal cell cultures to produce vaccines”. “We should not be injecting… aborted human fetal tissue into people”.A basic tenet of biochemistry is that you use the cheapest ingredients to get the job done. Viruses are finicky in that they don’t copy themselves – they need cells to do it. Just like if you want to copy a CD - you need a second CD! The simplest toolbox a biochemist can pull to make this happen is a commercially available cell culture that all biochemists can order online. You need virus particles to manufacture vaccine. The cells are the machinery that can make it for you. This is a near universal technique in labs that want to copy viruses for research. It would be like criticizing a random man who walked down the street with brown shoes, because these shoes were the same color as the suspect who robbed the convenience store last week. Everybody uses shoes – there’s nothing intrinsically negligent about shoes. As for the fetal tissue – the original cell line was derived from fetal lung cells. That cell line has been made into a commercial culture. Fetuses have not been involved in the biochemistry of these cells for decades now.Kindle pg 13: “Beginning in the early 1980s, the lead and oil industry mobilized public relations firms and scientific and medical consultants to lambast Needleman’s research and his credibility”.This actually happened. However, note that it IS the lead and oil industry which is at fault here. It is totally appropriate to protest the actions of big business here. However, the scientific method still prevailed. This has nothing to do with vaccine safety, one of the central arguments of this book. Needleman stuck to the scientific method. Judy Mikovits did not.Kindle pg 17: “Dr Morris irked his superiors by arguing that the research carried out by his unit demonstrated there was no reliable proof that flu vaccines were effective in preventing influenza”.The biggest reason that flu vaccines are not as effective as the other vaccines is that the flu virus keeps on changing. The analogy is that if you are trying to give your body a chance to fight a practice infection, the fighting is easy if the practice infection is the same as the real infection. If a virus with a different coat comes along, your immune system needs to regroup to fight the new enemy.Kindle pg 31: “The findings dovetailed with parental reports of autistic regression after a vaccination”.A true scientist would have also read: Denmark looked at over 650 000 children and tried to relate MMR vaccines with autism. They found no link. This data was out before the book was published.Kindle pg 35: “The revolutionary is shouted down for their new ideas”.Nope – science literacy demands that creative hypotheses be tested rigorously. It also demands that the research be repeatable. The only people who are shouted down are those who claim to be scientists and also simultaneously refuse to follow the scientific method.“masks will “activate” the virus and reinfect a mask-wearer over and over. “Viruses are quite fragile outside the body. They can break up because they have nothing to infect. Dry air and plain masks will destroy a virus if left there long enough. If you are infected once with a virus, you can’t get reinfected by the same virus over and over again. You should try to avoid contamination with a mask - if you constantly touch and retouch your mask during the pandemic without proper hand hygiene, you are likely to transmit a virus stuck on the mask to yourself or others.Kindle page 149: “XMR was poised to be much bigger than HIV”.XMR virus was later found to be an accidentally created virus in the laboratory. HIV is substantially bigger.Kindle page 291: “Among the first approaches we might try for any patient we suspect to be suffering from acquired immune dysfunction… is something called deuterium-depleted water”.Deuterium is another type of hydrogen that has one proton and one neutron. It is not radioactive. Guess what? This stuff occurs naturally everywhere, including your own body. You are born with the stuff and drink it every day. It is similar to regular water, except the hydrogen atoms are heavier than in regular water. As a result of the increased weight, it is a little more sticky than regular water, and you can hurt yourself if you drink the pure stuff day in and day out. Pure deuterium is super expensive and only found in research labs. Don’t worry about buying special water that is thousands of times more expensive than what you can get out of your home faucet. People are making money off of this, and you don’t need to be taken advantage of. It’s a waste of money.Bottom line – while her intention is to fight unethical top leadership, Judy Mikovits has strayed so far from the scientific method that she has completely lost credibility. Just a little bit of science literacy from the American public will allow anyone to see through the messages that this book is portraying. Fighting unethical top leadership is fantastic - but the method used in this book is tangential and illogical. Remember – when anyone tries to sell you stuff, including this author, ask how it works. Be curious. Ask for how the conclusions were derived. You don’t have to be a scientist – that’s the great thing about science literacy. The other great thing is that you don’t need to spend any money at all to be curious and ask questions – and then make simple experiments that help you confirm or deny your thoughts. Science only requires that you are motivated enough to uphold logical thinking and the scientific method. Uphold science literacy – and you will live in the amazing security of knowing that nobody can deceive you or take advantage of you.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3219QVMM95NO2","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2020","date":{"date":"July 19, 2020","unix":1595116800},"name":"Donna Moore","rating":5,"title":"Essential reading if you are concerned with Public Health and Truth.","review":"This book was easy to read.

Her treatment does not surprise me and I fear she still may be at risk from retaliation. I've always been blindly obedient to receiving a vaccine until my intuition (9th Logic) screamed - not to have a flu vaccine formulated from 12-month-old information. I've been proven right and haven't had flu for some years. Who, before this book new that mice brains were used in human vaccines, less alone the MMRV vaccine being a potential cause for autism, and upon further research why Humanizing mice brains is one of the reasons for aborting foetuses at late-stage pregnancies. IMO Collins should be sacked for patenting and profiting from a product derived from Judy's research, and Fauci investigated for crimes against humanity, unnecessarily causing tens of thousands of deaths in support of the CCP and corrupt WHO.

There is good documentation of this saga online from Science magazine and other sources.As for Big Pharma plotting against her, this makes no sense. Drug companies' profits would skyrocket if Mikovits' claims about retroviruses causing CFS and a host of other chronic diseases were true. They could make many billions of dollars selling anti-retroviral drugs like the ones successfully used to treat HIV/AIDS. Why would drug companies plot against someone whose theories promised to vastly increase their profits?The rest of the book is largely a fact-deprived rant against vaccines, dredging up antivaxers' favorite memes about Toxins, SV40, Andrew Wakefield (who she terms \"our greatest scientific martyr) and so on. Mikovits in an interview answered \"Absolutely not\" when asked if she was antivaccine. It's peculiar then that she spreads so much misinformation about vaccines, has a co-author who proclaims himself ''America's #1 Antivaxxer'', and has a foreword to her book written by noted antivaxer RFK Jr., who has compared vaccination to the Holocaust.People who are susceptible to conspiracy theories and stressed out by the current pandemic are embracing Mikovits' alternate version of reality. They may even be inclined to accept her grandiose ego (in the book Mikovits compares herself to Columbus, Galileo and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.).Sadly, when it comes to corruption in science, Mikovits' is part of the problem, not its solution.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RTTGNA0XREJ0F","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020","date":{"date":"July 23, 2020","unix":1595462400},"name":"Carolyn Landbeck","rating":5,"title":"Extremely informative","review":"I’m thoroughly enjoying this book.

She attempts to point a vast picture of how science and industry practices today are nothing but evil and have resulted in a struggle of good vs bad.It’s very hard to take her seriously after reading in Ch 1 alone how she brags about clever she was by pulling a getaway heist and avoiding the authorities when they showed up with a warrant to search her house and were looking for her. She then goes on to explain how innocent she is about how someone sabatoged her house by planting false claims and evidence for her to find. No one ever broke in (to her house) and she ironically leaves out the details of what the warrant was after and its details except only referring to it as “notebooks and a box of files” constantly (her summary of the warrant).Most of the following chapters after until about 6 are just personally stories about random people she collaborated with over the years who “also suffered at the evil hands” but ironically gained her favortism or advanced her career in someway. She’s lived a pretty nice life in this and again this is all in her own words. She says in Ch.2 or Ch.3 she used to fly with the high execs via helicopter and was “selected” to be the director of the National division she worked in for her XMRV discoveries.Every chapter after is just her personal anti-vaccine crusade about how vaccines are so dangerous due to how they’re designed and how we’re killing the population and big pharma is making away and protected. Here’s a note for you Judy (and to your work husband (I dare say secret lover) Frank)...VACCINES RECEIVED BY PEOPLE BENEFIT AND LIVES SAVED OUTWEIGH/TRIUMPH 1 MILLION TIMES OVER THAN THOSE WHO DONT GET THEM OR HAVE GOTTEN ILL!!! If we didn’t have vaccines then most of us probably wouldn’t be here!!! Growing it in animal cells tainted with viruses and in specialized parts is nothing new. There will always be a trade-off somewhere. Be thankful we have anything at all!!!I almost gave it a 2 star review because the Intro to the book (before Ch.1) is surprisingly good and sets a good mood..but quickly dies after Ch.1 and just falls down a long well of depression and narrow thinking.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R375O0EBT8V4U9","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2020","date":{"date":"June 29, 2020","unix":1593388800},"name":"Deborah Blackburn","rating":5,"title":"Get the book","review":"The book was reasonably priced and the contents eye opening and informative.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R35H60KCB3UQ6W","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2020","date":{"date":"June 29, 2020","unix":1593388800},"name":"Paula ","rating":5,"title":"Must Read Book!!","review":"I could not put it down and I will more than likely read this more than just one time.

It flows better. At times it feels almost like a personal advendure story, or maybe a thriller. There's less scientific detail, which gives it more punch.And punch it has. The story this book tells is shocking, infuriating, appalling. As someone who has lost 25 years to the chronic illness ME/CFS, it has been incredibly painful to read about how research that could have put me on the road to recovery a decade ago, that could have given me my life back, was deliberately and ruthlessly suppressed.This book explains how and why this happened. It details many of the forces and people who implemented this suppression, a massive fraud which has left thousands, if not millions, dead, and ruined the lives of countless more innocent victims. Including me, including several of my friends and loved ones.When I first got sick, I went to doctor after doctor, was subjected to test after test. I had been a staunch believer in the American medical system. I thought doctors were like gods: you get sick, you go to the doctor, you get well.They taught me how wrong I was. Those doctors, who I believed in and trusted, put me through hell on earth. Eventually I gave up and turned to alternative medicine, which hasn't cured me but at least slowed the progress of my illness and made life - at times - tolerable. But I never fully understood what had made me ill in the first place.Now, thanks to Dr. Mikovits and Mr. Heckenlively, do understand. It is clear how and why I got sick.

Melonakos","rating":5,"title":"We are being oppressed by dishonest scientists in positions of power","review":"I saw Judy Mikovits in her videos and in person when she spoke in Ramona, CA recently.She is a brilliant scientist, one of the most accomplished virologists of our time. Her work was instrumental in discovering how HIV/AIDS would no longer be a death sentence, but a manageable disease. She uncovered a link between animal retroviruses used to develop vaccines and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and other diseases, but the medical establishment has tried to suppress her work and harassed her and even jailed her and her research partners. It is not only shameful but illegal that they treated her like that, and it speaks to how corrupt this medical establishment is, including her one-time boss, Anthony Fauci.Judy has been speaking about this for some time, but nothing has demonstrated to those paying attention how corrupt the CDC, the WHO, and the NIAID are more than the corona virus disaster. They got everything wrong, from the predictions of millions of deaths to whether or not masks are harmful. They say we are not going to get back to normal till we are all contract traced, and all forced to get a vaccine? NO WAY! Why do they say nothing about informed consent? Have you ever wondered why your doctor never informs you of the risks of injecting foreign material into you or your child's body that may well wreak havoc on your immune system? We as patients should demand to be informed of the risks, and never be forced to submit to any medical procedure.This book details how the \"expert class\" are beholden to big donors like Bill Gates and the pharmaceutical companies that have \"captured\" these entities.They stand to make big profits from their experimental vaccines. And make no mistake, these vaccines are experimental. Judy Micovits demonstrates that the CDC suppresses science that might alert the public to the dangers of injecting live material into your body that has been grown in mouse tissue, dog tissue, horse tissue, or even WORSE, aborted human fetal tissue.Growing viruses in these animals can cause animal retroviruses to contaminate vaccines. And then these retroviruses can cause chronic illnesses like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, autism, (yes, they suppressed those studies), fibromyalgia, arthritis, and yes, cancer.So who do you believe? Someone like Judy and her colleagues who want to do honest science and help mankind, or those who stand to make mega-profits by hushing up risks to health, just like the tobacco companies did for so many years?At least get the verified testimony of people like Judy Mikovits, Anthony Wakefield, Robert Kennedy Jr., Dr. Mercola, and the growing movement of doctors, scientists, parents, and others who are waking up to how our medical establishment is placing its own interests before ours.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2IO7ZLJQJUGXN","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2020","date":{"date":"June 12, 2020","unix":1591920000},"name":"Sherri L Wilson","rating":5,"title":"Eye opener","review":"Learned there is so much I need to pay attention to and be aware of.

The authors are not doctors (and doctors are not researchers) but researchers of hitherto some renown. The tone of the book has a sense of urgency but is not a rant. It is lucid, rational, very easy to follow – and believe; but each reader will have to decide for herself which way to go. The authors main theme is that some vaccines are like the HIV which is just a virus, but when injected into the human body, may develop AIDS (the disease) in some people, and those vaccines in question, when injected into humans, cause any number of illness of which CFS and autism are two of them. The authors describe the fight to date, including the cases brought by the lawyer Mike Hugo. Hugo has his own personal story of his personal fight with his sister that led to Hugo's eventual disbarment.The authors tell stories that sound to the mainstream, like conspiracy theories. For example, how an expert Dr Zimmerman who testified in the trial of a case (Case C) in which he said the evidence of such a claim was not sufficient, but outside the court, he warned his employers that in some cases, the vaccine could cause autism in children. The second case (Case P) was settled with a non-disclosure clause. The third case (Case H) which, in Zimmerman’s view closely resembles Case P, and he would be so testifying. During the preceding weekend, the Department of Justice called Zimmerman and told him that his services were no longer required. The authors draw attention to the court known as The Vaccine Court in which the Master of the Court is ‘equivalent to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court’ (a bit of an overstatement, but the point is made). This court was set up in 1986 after the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. All such claims must be heard in this court – which seems strange that injury by other drinks or means go to the normal courts. To date, the authors say, up to four billion dollars have been paid by way of damages in this court.The reader has to be the jury, but as in the case of many juries, the full facts and the expertise required to help in the decision making are not available. But it is hard to imagine that for such a serious charge the truth had been hidden by a worldwide conspiracy of scientists and no independent investigation had been carried out.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R28ED7I8PPLUM4","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","date":{"date":"June 5, 2020","unix":1591315200},"name":"Suraj Pangal","rating":5,"title":"Great and Interesting Book!!","review":"Great Book!!

I decided to give it a read when government mismanagement of COVID-19 had me in no mood to trust to establishment. I watched the Plandemic video and was intrigued by Mikovits's claim that government scientists can take out personal patents on discoveries they make while under government employ. I am intrigued by the idea of profit-driven corruption in the medical establishment, especially in light of the opioid crisis. I decided to read this book with an open mind because I wanted to hear what else Mikovits had to say about the mechanics of government/medical establishment corruption. On that score, this book is a bust, and Dreamland by Sam Quinones or Shots in the Dark by Jon Cohen are much more illuminating and instructive. This book is a hot mess. Our girl Judy is all over the place, both in her writing style and in her subject matter. Her ego is downright delusional as she compares herself to Marie Curie, Galileo, and Christopher Columbus (not in the rapey/slavey/genocidey way, but in the sense that he thought the earth was round). She also more than once claims to have saved \"millions of lives.\" Get over yourself, girl! She is also petty, as she devotes a decent chunk of one chapter to discussing the outrage of someone referring to her as \"Ms\" instead of \"Dr,\" and how one time she got paid less for a job than she thought she should have. Put down that cross for a sec and take a rest, Judy! As far as the scientific stuff, she claims that everything from cancer, to autism, to auto-immune diseases, to chronic fatigue syndrome, to mystery conditions that doctors just can't explain, is due to the fact that the process for creating vaccines involves using animal tissue (but she also says that using human tissue is bad too, so I guess we're just screwed). Correlation? Check. Causation? Well, here is her illuminating thought on causation: \"Yes, I know, correlation does not mean causation. Just because when I walk into a crosswalk and go flying thirty feet at the same time a car barrels through the same crosswalk doesn’t mean I was hit by that car. Maybe there’s some other explanation. Like aliens did it. And at the same time, they smashed up the car with their laser beam.\" Wow, Judy. I guess we can't argue with that logic! A lot of her causation evidence she simply sums up with: \"That's not rocket science.\" I mean, I guess not, Judy. Things get really weird (I know, right?) toward the end, when she suggests that the Flint water crisis could be solved by putting cannabis in the water and that autism can be \"cured\" by having people with autism ingest or consume \"purified human feces\" from people who do not have autism in order to reset their gut microbes...or something. None of this would be complete without a good old fashioned homeopathic grift, and our girl Judy delivers by pimping deuterium-depleted water as a cure-all. If you are an anti-vaxxer who is looking for some confirmation bias, this is the book for you. Everyone else should check out the books I recommended earlier in the review instead.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R27GS2EERZSGDV","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2020","date":{"date":"June 10, 2020","unix":1591747200},"name":"GC","rating":5,"title":"Vaccines May be Dangerous","review":"Every American....especially those expecting a child or have small children....should read this book.

The corruption Dr. Mikovits writes about is both scientific (falsifying of data) and political (killing and blacklisting of whistleblowers). She seems like an amazing scientist and I’m surprised she has not been awarded the Nobel Prize for her discovery of the closest thing to a cure for AIDS to date (her doctorate thesis, which has saved the lives of literally tens of millions of people), I am also amazed she is still alive.Dr Mikovits’s field of expertise is retroviruses and without too much technical scientific detail or jargon she clearly describes her work and the significance of her finding. The gist is that the human genome is contaminated by a fair bit of retroviruses from other animals, but that most of the time this genetic material remains dormant. However, one of the main triggers that awakens these retroviruses is vaccinations because they stimulate immune responses. The other complication is that many of these vaccines are contaminated by being cultivated in other animal's tissue, so the viruses from these laboratory hosts are being introduced into the population in broad and relatively undocumented ways.Dr Mikovits was part of the team that discovered the family of XMRV retroviruses which is a causative link in many human auto-immune conditions – from Autism and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome to various forms of cancer (including prostate) and Alzheimer’s! Because her published research conclusively linked this retrovirus to the health industry blood supply and vaccine contamination in 2009, by 2011 she'd had her career destroyed (by a combination of the scientific, governmental deep state and industrial communities).Co-author Kent Heckenlively's contribution brings not only an expertise in the legal side of the vaccine harm issue, but also his legal training to present the material like a court case for us to weigh the evidence of and make up our own minds. I also liked the lengthy forward by RFK Jr.. It did a great job of introducing Dr. Mikovits and providing context.In many ways this book is terrifying (portraying that what man via science and technology has done in the quest for health is create a ticking time bomb within the human genome). And yet I’m glad to have read it, and highly recommend it.“… We know with scientific certainty that one of the most destructive factors in human history is the jumping of animal viruses into humans... author Jared Diamond in his book Guns, Germs and Steel makes the argument that the reason European contact with Native Americans was so devastating is that we had become infected with viruses from our domestic animals…“I make the case that what we have done in the laboratory mimics the worst of what happened in European populations and animals in the Middle Ages and traveled across the ocean. The sad possibility is that our children and immune-compromised are the Native Americans in this scenario.” (p. 123-124)","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1O0GNCOB8YJY","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","date":{"date":"June 5, 2020","unix":1591315200},"name":"HARviews","rating":1,"title":"Discredited scientist spreads conspiracy theories","review":"The book is a steady stream of conspiracy theories from start to finish.

At the same time it is a reasoned and sometimes technically detailed account of her 30 years’ research into the mysteries of the retrovirus, and her reasons for viewing these camoflage-artists as the culprits in many modern diseases. The thriller side of the story is gripping; the scientific side is demanding. The two are in counterpoint.As Mikovits closes in on conclusions that could not be addressed without bankrupting very powerful people, the hunt gets dangerous. I knew the general topic, and, as a personal point of entry, I know several individuals whose children’s developmental problems (autism) date from vaccinations, but I did not know that Judy prayed for her enemies while she was in jail, an awesome fact under the circumstances. On every level, an extraordinary story.I really wish there were an index because there is a daunting amount of information and there are so many terms, persons, and events to keep track of.

Dr. Mikovits never studied XMRV retroviruses in vaccines or autism. In fact, she ignores the scientific literature since 2011 stating that XMRV is a laboratory contaminant derived from random genetic recombination between mouse cell lines, evidence that it is not even a human pathogen.The book delves into unsubstantiated accusations against Dr. Fauci, driven by her resentment toward the scientific community for her own scientific fraud in 2009. She lost a $1.5 million NIAID grant after being fired by her former employer WPI and then stole intellectual property. Although WPI has had its controversies over XMRV testing, it rightfully won a civil lawsuit over company property in 2012 that rendered Mikovits bankrupt. These Nevada court documents, including affidavits by Pfost and McKenzie, are public information. Mikovits later delves into homeopathic medicine with questionable ideas about deuterium-depleted water and microbiota of autistic people.Please do not support charlatans by buying any of Mikovits' propaganda books.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R39DRUERPBQR7Q","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020","date":{"date":"June 5, 2020","unix":1591315200},"name":"kristi whitley","rating":5,"title":"DO NOT LINE UP FOR A VACCINATION WITHOUT READING THIS!","review":"A must-read for everyone.

The book is poorly written, reflective of why research studies need to be duplicated by others, why some researchers have bizarre ideas based on their own beliefs, and how social media allows conspiracy theories to be spread that are false. For example, it is difficult to know who to believe on social media when medical professionals are against vaccines (or suggesting that retroviruses are contaminating vaccines or causing autism). That is why you need critical thinking skills and sufficient medical/research knowledge to understand why and how falsehoods are being spread to confuse us. This book has few references for published data and suggests personal theories based on past research, emails, and conversations.As for Judy Mikovits, this is an example of one of her theories: use deuterium-depleted water, cannabis, and then suramin to treat chronic inflammatory diseases......got that theory? I am so confused after reading this book about what is true or false since there are no well-designed research studies for efficacy or safety.....just rambling theories. She is a supporter of medical cannabis for chronic health conditions and also a user. As a pharmacist, I question her overwhelming support for cannabis when it can cause psychiatric changes and there is minimal data for its long-term use for efficacy and safety.She has met Roger Stone (discussed vaccines and religious freedoms) and the book's forward (12 pages) was written by Robert Kennedy Jr and is a lot about vaccines. If you watch the video about an upcoming movie “Plandemic” you will see why the information in this book is connected and both have spread conspiracy theories and are part of the anti-vaccine movement.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3K82ERKDQUIOX","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2020","date":{"date":"June 1, 2020","unix":1590969600},"name":"RJ Herrmann","rating":5,"title":"Follow the Money!","review":"Dr. Mikovits exposes the corruption and false narrative propagated by various individuals, government organizations, and media that collaborate to deny the American people about the truth in science and research.

I understand Dr. Mikovits and others are controversial people but that certainly doesn't mean we should disregard controversial people. The subject of Vaccines is front and center of the end game solution for COVID-19. Thus I've concluded my reading of Plague of Corruption and of course, per the request of Dr. Mikovits from the beginning of the book, go ahead and make up your own mind what we think about what she tells us. Dr. Mikovits also discloses in Chapter 11 she understands that she did a lot of complaining which often times disguises what we really need to learn, understand and know about Vaccines. Thus, it was Chapter 10 that provided me with my Aha moment. As I see it Chapter 10 carefully states that there are viruses in all of us lying dormant; this is a scientific fact. Ebola case models demonstrated that certain villages in Africa affected by Ebola show those villages were vaccinated? Okay, thus which begs the question, when compared to unvaccinated villages \"Did vaccinations in some way wake up the dormant viruses living in our bodies.\" Great book, it expanded my knowledge base and it made me think how much death followed many researchers!

Ultimately proven to be right, these rebels include Galileo (who suggested that the Earth was not in the center of the solar system), Ignaz Semmelweis (who held the radical notion that antiseptic solutions should be used prior to surgery), Herbert Needleman (who claimed that lead in gasoline and paint was poisoning people), and Dr. Bernice Eddy (who discovered that a cancer-causing monkey virus, SV40, had contaminated 80 million Salk polio vaccines).Although these whistleblowing scientists were finally vindicated (sometimes after their deaths), people today seem to forget that each of them experienced profound attacks against their professional careers, their work was censored, their mental health questioned, their grants withdrawn or laboratories destroyed, and even spent time in prison.The women in this group were called “hysterical” or were simply demeaned as “spinsters.”Big Pharma is doing ALL they can to vilianize Dr. Mikovits, and everyone should be suspicious of these attacks.There are hundreds of scientists every year whose work is disproven, but they are not censored, attacked, and jailed for these actions.Everyone should smell a big RAT by the degree of attack of her work.She IS onto something important.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RPH6TOKUYAPLP","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2020","date":{"date":"May 23, 2020","unix":1590192000},"name":"Luna","rating":1,"title":"Not worth the purchase","review":"I wish I could return it.

A few of them were given unfairly by people who accidentally bought the Kindle version (not the authors fault), and only a few who just didn’t like it with not any valid points. I find most people I talk to are either just simply afraid of the truth, in denial of it, or are experiencing deep guilt over their decision to vaccinate their children who now (many I know) are living with vaccine injury.

Most likely, like me, you want to understand what is happening to our country right now. Even if that is not your motivation, you probably found the title and Dr. Mikovits interviews intriguing and decided to give it a read. This book is not about being an anti-vaxxer or a pro-vaxxer. This book simply lets one into the corrupt side of certain government and private entities that are supposed to be working for us. I would suggest before you read this book, try to put out of your mind anything you've heard negative, or positive about the authors and read it with an open mind. While I was in the middle of this book, I heard a slew of negative comments about Dr. Mikovits online after a certain mini-documentary was put out there. I pushed all of that back and finished the book. I am so glad I did. Not only would I love to sit with her over a cup of coffee and talk with her, I found this book extremely informative regarding certain issues such as vaccines and scientific research. It has strengthened my decision to say no to certain vaccines for my children. (I did mention earlier that this book is not about pro or anti vaccination, but it does make one think about the topic.) It also will make me question my doctors a little more and has put in my mind that sometimes you have to be your own health advocate, even if the mainstream says otherwise. No one should just take a pill or get a shot without research and questioning. I once was prescribed Singulair to my then 12 year old when he had a bad cold. I got home with the medication, read the side effects, and decided to let the cold run its course. It was a safer bet to me than having him possibly suffer mental health side effects. Thank you Doctors Judy and Kent for putting yourselves out there to help others. To everyone else, be aware of your self worth enough to seekout second opinions if they are needed and question your medical professionals when you feel they are not truly advocating for you or are just treating you like a number, or a product on a factory line. Keep searching until you find the medical professional you deserve.

My parents had me vaccinated for everything that our era required. I'm scared now, at 70, wondering when my world will collapse with some superbug because of those d*** vaccinations. As I read this book, even though some of it was too technical for my brain, I realized that, even though I got vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, I had mumps (only on one side though), I had measles and rubella (we called it roseola). I also got chicken pox at the same time I had measles, despite being vaccinated for both! In my 50s I suffered several bouts of shingles, which we have been told anyone who has had chickenpox would be in danger of suffering through. And now my physician wants me to get a shingles vaccination? If the vaccine for chickenpox didn't protect me from getting it, why on earth would I want to endanger myself getting the Shingles vaccine??? I would probably end up having a dibillatating case of Shingles, much worse than the episodes I've already gone through. And I'll be passing on the pneumonia vaccine too. And not getting the Tdap (tetanus-diptheria and pertussis) booster either. I'm done with putting myself in more danger because someone hasn't stopped the vaccination program, and taken the time to thoroughly test all vaccines and reformulate them. This situation is buried in political agendas between big Pharma and the government. I pray that it is resolved before I leave this earth. Until then, I'm anti-vaccination all the way.

I was not able to get the book delivered to me quick enough, so I opted for the e-book. I could not stop reading it. Maybe it's because these topics fascinate me.I learned so much about the making ofvaccines, and how they are made from animals, and how animals, like mice, can carry these viruses that can enter the humans through the vaccines. The book covers the career of Dr. Mikovits who worked at NCI, among other places and who authored over 50 peer-reviewed journals in her field. I liked the way the story unfolded, and the way it was written. I plan to also get co-author Kent Heckenlively's book. They make a great pair.I found several topics running through this book - the historical aspect of HIV and its treatment, autism's link to vaccines, the work of Dr. Mikovits and why she was jailed (actually, she didn't get a court hearing, and her lab books were confiscated), how her career was ruined, and how brilliant a scientist she is. I was impressed by her knowledge and humbled at the same time for all the contributions that she has given to science and society.I highly recommend this book, not just for the informational value, but seeing courage and leadership being enacted at its strongest point. By reading this book, I felt that our government and the Americans are missing out on her valuable insights; she has much experience in viruses that could help this country deal better with the COVID-19 and save lives.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3593MY7019W89","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2020","date":{"date":"May 7, 2020","unix":1588809600},"name":"Nancy Andritsch","rating":5,"title":"Return kindle order","review":"I would like to cancel this order.

Nye","rating":3,"title":"interesting to read and raises many questions about vaccine safety;very poorly written","review":"Whether you think she's a kook or a whistleblower, Judy Mikovits' book is an interesting read that will definitely raise some questions in your mind about the validity of research and the power of government and the pharmaceutical industry to bend reality to their benefit.Mikovits comes across as an anti-vaccination person, although she claims she is not.She does not, however, say which vaccines she feels are safe.She raises some very serious allegations about how vaccines are created in the lab, though, and concerns about animal viruses being transmitted to humans by virtue of how vaccines are manufactured.She also raises serious concerns about how far the government and powerful companies will go to silence those who speak out against them.My biggest complaint with this book is it is written very poorly.The story line is disjointed and, at times, difficult to follow.I am a physician and understand the medical jargon, but a lay person would have great difficulty wading through all of the technical information presented that really should be conveyed in simpler terms for public consumption.The first 30 pages of this book are pretty exciting where Mikovits describes what appears to be stalking and a possible kidnap attempt on her life.But the rest of the book takes off on a tangent, slows to a rather boring pace, and never picks up where the initial 30 pages of excitement left off.She spends a lot of time writing about her accomplishments and why she believes she is being silenced.She has nothing good to say about Dr. Anthony Fauci but spends no time explaining why.When I first bought this book, I really wanted to believe this woman.I heard her interviewed online, and what she had to say sounded pretty terrifying.After reading the book, though, it raises questions in my mind as to whether or not she's truly a whistleblower whose career has been thoroughly destroyed by powerful interests or merely a malcontent who thinks her beliefs should be taken more seriously.Overall, I found this an interesting book to read.It raises some very serious questions about vaccine safety.But it really left a lot of information hanging without much explanation.It had the potential to be a real blockbuster with better writing.Quite honestly, the best part of the book is the rather lengthy forward written by Robert F.

Dr. Mikovits enjoyed a distinguished 20-year career at the National Cancer Institute and in private industry before running afoul of the scientific mafia that has gained control over our leading medical and public health institutions.Because Dr. Mikovits called attention to the errors and misdeeds of people at top levels in those institutions and documented persistent attempts to cover up their mistakes, those same people destroyed her professional career and blackballed her from working with any established institution in her field of virology. They even locked her out of receiving information from medical libraries! In Orwell’s words, they turned her into an “unperson” in her field. Nonetheless, she continues to work with patients suffering from viral infections and their support groups while pursuing a modest private consulting practice.If Dr. Mikovits has been \"discredited\" by those in power, why listen to her? I have listened because, over the years, she has dealt at first hand with such eminent figures as Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Francis Collins and Dr. Robert Gallo and thus is in a unique position to present evidence of their corruption.And in her books, boy, does she dish it out!This is one brave whistleblower!Yet, in the six years since her gag order was lifted and her first book was published, none of the people she accused of misconduct has sued her for libel or even responded to her accusations, either publicly or privately.Why not? I believe it’s because Dr. Mikovits holds the evidence to back up her claims and they know it.And, to date, she has withstood their attempts to intimidate her through false arrest, hostile surveillance and other forms of harassment.The high-level misdeeds that Dr. Mikovits recounts in her two books include suppression of research data, coercion of subordinates to falsify research and destroy evidence, denial of grave risks to the public from contamination to our national blood supply, and subjecting every human on the planet to catastrophic risk from contaminated vaccines harboring dangerous animal viruses from the monkey, mouse, chicken, and cow cell lines used to create the vaccines.If you have any doubts that many or most of our current vaccines pose serious health risks to patients of all ages, then read this book. Dr. Mikovits’s compelling evidence will lay out exactly why, how and when those risks arose.And if you consider criticism of vaccines to be no more than conspiracy theory, her evidence will likely shake your confidence to the core.That this book’s publication date was delayed until April 2020 represents, in my view, an act of divine providence. That’s because this year’s coronavirus epidemic has caused millions of Americans to raise questions about the judgment and motives of officials at the NIH, CDC and FDA. And the most serious questions are being directed at Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has held his position as the head of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for some 37 years.How did Dr. Fauci get that appointment and what has been his record over the years? Read PLAGUE OF CORRUPTION to get the other side of the Dr. Fauci story. It’s not pretty.I have given this book four stars out of five. The subject matter rated five stars but the organization, editing and technical presentation fell short of perfection. Read it and make allowances for Dr. Mikovits being a career researcher rather than a journalist.PLAGUE OF CORRUPTION is a once-in-a-generation eye-opener that is likely to have a profound impact on how Americans view their country's public health and scientific establishment.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1USAJ9HN4TQXN","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2020","date":{"date":"April 21, 2020","unix":1587427200},"name":"Robert Meyer","rating":5,"title":"Health Freedom, Ethics, and Liberty all Thrive on the Truth - Thanks Judy for Standing for Ethics!","review":"Great opportunity is provided here to learn more of what goes on behind the scenes when corporate and political interests take the simple truth of scientific research and then manipulate it to create a business model for profits.These business models then develop policy for health care that often has little to do with the needs of the individual.Thanks Judy for helping so many to step into the light and liberty of knowing the truth-Joshua -Robert -Teresa -","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3OZC1RXQY9MRZ","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2020","date":{"date":"May 6, 2020","unix":1588723200},"name":"david min","rating":1,"title":"Pure garbage","review":"Can't trust anything this anti-vaccination proponent says.

At times it almost felt as if I was reading a fiction novel that had me on the edge of my seat. The level of deceit that has played out on so many levels could be disheartening if it were not for the likes of Dr. Judy Mikovits and those who have gone both before and after her in pursuit of the truth. These scientists and doctors give us Hope for a better world.❤️The lengths those have gone to to cover up deadly, yet monetarily rewarding mistakes caused me to catch my breath at times. This book should change all who read it. I for one can no longer keep my beliefs to myself. Now more than ever is a time to stand up for the truth. Stand up for those who no longer have a voice. Stand up in support of those scientists and doctors who have sacrificed so greatly because they discovered the truth. I feel a moral obligation to not sit by idly and watch the world change around me but to be a part of the solution.I will read this book again and again as there is still so much to synthesize.If the current state of our world has led you to ask more questions and dig deeper or perhaps you simply want to deepen your knowledge base, then this book would be an excellent tool on your journey!Michelle Giganti","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RF4SNOU2SYMDO","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020","date":{"date":"April 26, 2020","unix":1587859200},"name":"Dancingstarheart💖&RelexivelyCatlike","rating":5,"title":"Thoroughly documented account of fraud & corruption","review":"Dr Judy Mikovits and Kent Heckenlively have done it again!

The unspoken rule is that only official avenues of research are pursued that promises to result in a patent and a highlyprofitable product.Dr Mikovits appears to have run into a similar buzzsaw in her work with viruses and vaccines.

And yet, we INTENTIONALLY perturb the immune system of every man, woman, and child in this country from cradle to grave. Over and over again. We inject material that is toxic. Knowingly toxic ingredients. And then when we connect those dots we are met with extreme denial. Denial without any evidence provided. It is hard to believe we have allowed it this long. Sure, we know mercury and aluminum are heavy metals that are not healthy for the body - but our scientists assure us that they are not dangerous. But more important than even the heavy metals are the contaminants that got in there from growing viruses in animals and picking up other things not intended and not purified out. How can you purify something you don't even know is there? This is how we got SV40 - a monkey kidney viruses that causes cancer and went out in the polio vaccine. This is how we got XMRV - a retrovirus implicated in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome that came from passing virus through mouse brains and contaminated cell cultures. What else is hiding in those lab created cell cultures intended for injection into humans?We are all suffering now from the mistakes made from our \"scientists\" in the past who rushed into production on pharmaceuticals for public consumption without the proper safety measures. They fail to present us with sufficient evidence that these materials are fully safe and effective. They demonize anyone who inquires about it, and bury the evidence of harm that they do find. This is the definition of corruption.This book gives you a glimpse into the world of the institutions and characters who have been involved in making public policy. How financial and political interests are more important that the truth about what scientists like Dr Mikovits are finding. I am not as hopeful as Kent & Judy that the \"faith in science\" can be restored. Because the perpetrators will never come forward and admit what they did.They hold entrenched positions in government agencies and would rather burn the evidence than admit that they poisoned the human population and withheld from us out of hubris, corruption, and greed.I am so grateful to Robert F Kennedy Jr for taking up the topic, writing the Forward, and not being intimidated by the opposition. And to Kent and Judy for their collaboration that makes this difficult topic so easy to understand. There is a lot of scientific language but the writing makes it very accessible to the reader. Science is just a matter of terms and processes that anyone can learn. Never let someone tell you that the \"science\" is too complex for the average person. We get it.This book is very timely! As it is released we are fighting the first \"pandemic\" of our modern age. And we watch another retrovirus enter the human population to cause who knows what kind of havoc. We are watching how those very same characters and institutions who habitually hide information from us try to come across as believable and trustworthy. We desperately need the knowledge and insight of Dr Judy Mikovits to understand and go forward. I hope she is invited to be part of the Presidents's advisors. I can think of no better person to help us through this confusing and dangerous times. Get the book. Read it. Become part of the red pilled force that is growing every day.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1E3VUBR9QIA97","asin":{"original":"1510752242","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2020","date":{"date":"April 19, 2020","unix":1587254400},"name":"Mitch R","rating":5,"title":"Dr Judy Mikovits for Director of the NIH Please!","review":"This woman is a saint who dedicated her life’s work to finding cures to diseases people had yet to to even understand or believe existed.

As a scientist she worked on the development of immunizations until she became troubled by some of the methods that were being used and covered from the public, and because she wouldn't agree to disclaim her findings,she was fired. Although some of the scientific terminology is beyond what most of us understand, the stories are alarming and the message is clear ... nearly all immunizations are responsible for the poor health of today's population, and there are evil people out there who want to keep it that way.

For many vaccines, the mortality rates for the diseases they were created to eradicate were at record lows PRIOR to the introduction of the vaccine. She gives evidence to back up the reasons why disease was already in decline and how the diagnosis criteria had been changed to favor the appearance of vaccine success. She details reasons for efficacy issues like original antigenic sin and antibody dependent enhancement; she explains how they can weaken the immune response or lead to asymptomatic spread of disease. The last chapters are dedicated to alternative prevention and treatment.The tone of this book is different than others of similar topic. Humphries’ focus is not on Autism, toxic ingredients, or legal battles (accept when relevant to the story of a particular vaccine’s development). She sticks to the What and Why of history. I was familiar with vaccine safety issues for several years prior to reading Dissolving Illusions, and I still learned a TON of new information. I consider it a must read for anyone concerned with vaccines. I read this during the quarantine. There is no better time than now for people to realize the limitations of vaccines and know that we cannot look to them as a savior.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2TS01EZ8199E8","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020","date":{"date":"May 14, 2020","unix":1589414400},"name":"Trisha Connelly","rating":5,"title":"The whole truth anput vaccines your child's pediatrician won't tell you","review":"This book should be REQUIRED reading for ALL medical professionals.

They'd rather follow like pigs to the political power grab slaughter, believing the usual lies of the CDC and NIH. REAL doctors; those who fix broken arms, sew up blood vessels and lacerations, deal with accidents etc., these doctors only make up 10% of medicine. The other 90% is what we call disease medicine. This is where it's anybody's guess, and today in modern times evil spirits and demons have been replaced by \"viruses,\" the \"germ theory\" and the like.This book is a great historical number line reference that shows the basic untruths of the disease medical industry and the fear, pain, suffering and loss of fortunes and happiness it causes. The ONLY modern pandemic is public ignorance, - the complete abandon of common sense, REAL HEALTH EXPERIENCE (99.99% never experience it) self reliance.100, 200 years ago all the main \"scourges\" of western disease were completely wiped out with sanitation, clean drinking water, plumbing, and city planning and health and hygiene laws (like no dead human or animal bodies in the streets of homes and more...) NOT VACCINES OR MEDICAL CHEMICAL CURES. (But they take credit).When I was only 15 (45 years ago) I remember discovering that there was a doctors strike in Great Britain for about a year and as a result there were something like 78% less deaths from illness that year. Then about a decade later there was a shorter six month or so strike in Los Angeles California resulting in proportionately less deaths that period as well.I knew that one of the major causes of death, according to their own numbers is iatragenics or death by doctor- this is mostly by drugs- and the victims die NOT due to what they \"went in for\" was made very clear.There is so much info in this book that is in one place that I have learned all my life.This is a truly great book that should be on the top of the list for anyone at any age for any purpose- this is incredibly important information- information that is sadly lacking in our \"woke\" society.The only pandemic we have is that of ignorance and stubborn adherence to fantasy and modern folklore.

Have not read it yet. Don't have a stand one way or another. I gave mu children some vaccines but not others. I didn't have a logical reason, just a fear that I was not given full information, and there was undue pressure for me to give the vaccines. I didn't like that, I felt something was wrong in that picture, but at the time (almost 30 years ago) I stood alone and spoke to nobody about not giving the vaccines \"required\". One of them got the mumps, it was not a big deal. No major complications happened. Allof them got chicken pox. Again, no problem. When I was a child in Europe many of my friends got mumps I didn't, but was not vaccinated. I DID get German measles. Let me tell you: worst thing I ever remember having. Horrendous high temperature and pain. I survived with no consequences whatsoever. My brother became sick with symptoms assigned to side effects of MMR vaccine, ending in encephalitis and brain damage. It is not until recently that these symptoms have been identified as related to the vaccine. My point is: why are people getting so angry over a book? And why are people being pressured into vaccination without enough information? And also... A big profit vaccine industry seems to have way too much financial strength to unduly influence public opinion. I don't trust their \"findings\" and \"research\" but I am not willing to blindly follow claims of the opposition believers. I am willing to either remain neutral, and do whatever I want at my own risk, or else spend countless hours reading and researching myself just to probably end up where I am right now. But the bottom line really is the same as for abortion: if you don't want it, don't get it. I know that people think that with vaccines they are \"protecting\" the general population, but that's where I draw the line: you cannot sacrifice the freedom of others to protect your own.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R2W89UXK373AJT","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2019","date":{"date":"June 30, 2019","unix":1561852800},"name":"Michelle","rating":5,"title":"A Must Read!","review":"Informative and intriguing, this book is a compelling read.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1657TBOFGG7UM","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2019","date":{"date":"June 28, 2019","unix":1561680000},"name":"Eric A.","rating":5,"title":"Excellent read.

Looking into the peer reviewed journals I realized that only the developers of the vaccines and the government were allowed to do any real studies on it (at least in the US). What a recipe for disaster and corruption! I wish the book would have gone into more detail about the information/studies/statistics given to doctors and delve more into why they are such big proponents of vaccination. I know reimbursement, medical school and professional consequences are a part of it but my pediatrician have been so convinced. And they are honorable, caring individuals that do look at research so I wonder if the authors bias has overlooked at least some of the benefits.

I do enjoy historical accounts, and it was really eye-opening to read about how people lived in centuries past, in a more graphic, realistic way. In reading this book, I began to re-evaluate my views of \"The Good Old Days\" and realized that it wasn't a world of fresh air, no pesticides, and cleaner living - at ALL! Perhaps for some people it was, but for many, it was a squalid, wretched time, with poor food, unsanitary living conditions, poor medical care and horrific working conditions. And that's an understatement. The putrid living conditions were mind boggling to me, but they have pictures and documentation to prove it. I always assumed women were all stay-home moms until modern-day America, but that's not true, either. Women had many children and had to work incredibly long hours and often couldn't even nurse or tend to their babies. Who knew?! And formula wasn't then what it is now, nor did they really sterilize things. So the historical account of living conditions really helped me understand how these diseases were more lethal then. You can really imagine influenza striking these malnourished, over-worked, impoverished people and just devastating them. I was also stunned at how primitive and disgusting the methods of inoculation were in those days. Not very scientific, no screening or quality control, no purity of product. They didn't even sterilize needles and often did arm-to-arm vaccination. In any event, This book was really an eye opener. The authors definitely researched thoroughly and provide citation on every page. I initially hesitated to purchase this book for some time because it was a bit expensive for me, but am glad I bought it. I definitely recommend it.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3PS0SH949DV9X","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2019","date":{"date":"April 13, 2019","unix":1555113600},"name":"Starboard10","rating":5,"title":"A must read","review":"This is such an important book for anyone considering vaccination.

Granted, I have always had an open mind towards ideas, especially ideas that fly in the face of convention. But this book? these are not \"ideas\" but cold, hard, ugly FACTS. and that's why this is a MUST READ. for Everyone. this is the biggest issue of our time!!People have been against mandated (used to be called \"compulsory\") vaccinations for the past 200 years! The mainstream media wouldn't have you think that, tho! Imagine, doctors going door to door with police officers, holding people down and vaccinating them against their will. Ludacris, right? absolutely! But it really happened! These authors demonstrate amazingly how better hygiene, better sanitation, and better nutrition, NOT VACCINES, helped to eradicate these common diseases (and the authors give deep chapters going in depth into EACH \"disease\" that vaccines are often touted as having \"eradicated\"--the charts provided ALONE show, clearly, that ALL the diseases that mainstream media and the establishment claim vaccines eriadicated were actually basically eradicated DECADES BEFORE ANY VACCINE WAS INTRODUCED but that's just one nugget of gold from this book).AND!! they provide great, lost information about actual remedies and nutrition habits that are preventative against many diseases. Yall, it's all about having better sanitation and better nutrition; once these things improved around the turn of the 20th century, the diseases--and the mortality rates--basically all but disappeared! This book was amazing, I read it cover to cover in two days (its about 500 pages) and it is reaffirming to anyone who has ever doubted the efficiency of vaccines. People have been AGAINST this kind of thing FOR CENTURIES. so, you are NOT crazy! You are NOT \"anti-science\"! You have COMMON SENSE just as our ancestors did before!I highly encourage everyone to buy and read this book, because this is one of the biggest problems probably of our time. Humans will look back on this age--of 70 vaccinations before the age of 5--as pure unadulterated insanity.Not to mention, vaccine manufacturers have blanket legal protection from any harm/damages their products may cause (thanks to 1986 Vaccine Injury Act) and remember its a trillion dollar industry (well, Big Pharma plays its part in it too). Its all too clear why they are censoring this topic right now--if we put it up to a REAL debate, they would LOSE.Peace and love.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1SWOUXBAYD1IE","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2019","date":{"date":"March 29, 2019","unix":1553821200},"name":"Kenneth R. Tarr","rating":5,"title":"Countering David A. Rintoul's negative review","review":"In his one-star review of Dissolving Illusions, submitted on March 19, 2018, David A. Rintoul avoids discussing what is perhaps the main contention in Dissolving Illusions. The authors of that book present convincing evidence that there was a steady and progressive decline in infectious diseases from around 1900 until the present, long before the invention of vaccines, and that the decline was the result of improvements in sanitation, diets, and heathier lifestyles, not in the production and proliferation of vaccines. However, in his review Rintoul says absolutely nothing about this crucial point. Therefore, based on this fact and in view of his many other mistakes and falsehoods, I conclude that instead of presenting substantive arguments and factual evidence, Rintoul’s review is full of repeated contradictions, subjective statements, and superficial, emotional assertions. These are some of Rintoul’s contradictions. In Point 1 he claims that Dissolving Illusions gives only simple answers, but in his Conclusion he praises Mnookin’s book because “the simple easy answers sought by many [and provided by Mnookin] are not found in this book [Dissolving Illusions].” Also in Point 1 he says he “suspects that a careful reading of this book [Dissolving Illusions] will reveal more lies.” Since he claims to have given the book a careful reading, why would he now say he “suspects”rather than he “knows”? In Point 4 he says that the book that gives only simple answers contains graphs (commonly used in all science research) that are “unsophisticated bivariate analyses” with“confounding variables.” In other words, why does simple-answers Dissolving Illusions contain so many [56] useless and complicated graphs? In Point 7 he claims that the authors of Dissolving Illusions misrepresent the facts in interpreting the 1964 study when even a layperson can read that study and see that it is Rintoul who has misinterpreted it.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2GABEY61OPINB","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2019","date":{"date":"March 29, 2019","unix":1553821200},"name":"Sarah Radtke","rating":5,"title":"You will know more than your pediatrician","review":"This book is the authoritative history of illness and vaccines.

Going into the facts that are witheld from the general public, ex:most outbreaks occur and the majority of people who get sick HAVE BEEN vaccinated.Ex:That getting the 'wild' version of the virus means life-long immunity, but getting a vacc that generally only lasts in the body for a few months and not decades, doesn't lead to this helpful immunity.Ex; the truth behind 'deaths' of diseases like mumps, chicken pox, etc... I like this book not only bc it's written by a doc who has seen the ramifications and has been treated as a pariah in the community once she started simply questioning the safety of vacc.If people are willing to believe blindly that the gov't and big pharma, which is out for profits, is really in it to 'save' your children then you are probably not going to like this book and you may just want to move on. If, however, you are willing to read, absorb and process the cited facts and documented history laid out here you may be reachable.She addresses many supposedly good arguments that rabidly pro-vacc people push.One thing, remember (now, don't get triggered! ;)) many pro-vacc'rs squeal that people who don't jump on their 'trust blindly-go ahead and stick my kid with a needle'' bandwagon are AGAINST vaccinating.That, in many cases, is a flat out lie.Just bc people question, research and come to their own conclusions based on said evidence doesn't mean they are against vaccinating. They just chose to do it in longer steps and in a more careful manner regarding how the process is carried out.Regardless, this IS a VERY informative, fact and history based book.Excellent and eye-opening read.

I never really questioned it, but something didn't sit right with me when we weren't given a choice to get flu vaccines anymore at most hospitals. The worst was in 2017 and I was 8 months pregnant. I didn't want the flu vaccine because I had seen and experienced illness after being vaccinated. I was essentially forced to get the flu shot by my employer and I got very ill soon after that right before I delivered my baby. I regret that decision now, but I still didn't question vaccines. I vaccinated my baby according to schedule for the first 6 months of life. She was incredibly colicky and developed eczema right after her 2 month shots. She was miserable. I wish I had looked into vaccines before I allowed any of my children to be vaccinated. I listened to the medical community and media that labeled \"anti-vaxxers\" as crazy people. In reality, they are the informed ones.The medical community and the government agencies that are supposed to monitor public health are completely corrupted by the pharmaceutical industry. It's absolutely sickening.Dr. Humphries is a hero to speak up and go against the grain. I only wish I would have known this information sooner. My children have been poisoned in order to prevent them from getting diseases that are very mild today. And in exchange, one has asthma and another has eczema and food allergies.

It is so totally thorough and above reproach (let’s face it, it has to be in this day and age where anyone even hinting at questioning a vaccine is nailed to a proverbial cross) that the only people who could possibly have an issue with it are those who have a vested interest in suppressing the truth along their stupid little trolls, both paid and unpaid. The trolls themselves are incapable of intelligent thought, lack morality of any kind, and more than likely haven’t even touched the book let alone read it. Read their reviews and you’ll see what I mean.The book goes back to the good old days were living in squalor and filth were the norm and people died of all sorts of diseases caused by exposure to dirty sewage, rancid food, and other equally deplorable conditions. Animals were diseased and disease all around was a way of life. The diseases of the day are covered in descriptive detail in the book.Next, the authors move onto smallpox and the first vaccine. History is quite a bit different than the party line that this vaccine “eradicated smallpox.” It did not, quite the contrary. Lots of information on contaminated vaccines is offered before moving onto polio, pertussis, and measles. The book winds up explaining the critical importance of vitamin C and other lost remedies many of which are likely to be sitting in your homes right now. This part is pure gold. If you think allopathic medicine and a white coat is the ONLY option, you are not going to see the value. That’s a crying shame, maybe not so much for you personally but your children.This is a long and detailed read. It was indeed a slow one and if you are like me, someone with firm reading goals, you might feel impatient with the slower pace but it is well worth your time to read this book cover to cover. However, even if you don’t and you skip around, read only pertinent sections at a time or spend more time just covering graphs and data, it is all time well spent. The sections on natural and lost remedies alone are worth the price of the book even if only to ameliorate the fear surrounding any illness by balancing it with a sense of individual empowerment.JFK once stated that the one thing worse than a lie is the myth perpetuated by that lie. Vaccines are perhaps the biggest modern example of a lie told so many times over that it is unquestionably and with no thought required accepted as a universal truth. This is the comfortable choice.

He kept complaining, “my legs.” And wouldn’t Assist when I carried him out and looked zoned out. When I put him down to walk himself he flopped and said he couldn’t and I assumed he was just babying it.He slept for three days straight which I called Abbie worried and they said it was Normal and then began a zoned out period in which he also lost control of his bowels, wouldn’t talk, seemed confused when asked anything and began to wAil and whine at every response. At the same time our daughter began to have manic behavioral symptoms, everything touching her she was frantic, couldn’t explain her thoughts before loosing her point and becoming irrational and angry, lost control of her Bowels and began complaining of back and leg pain so much she’d wake in the night screaming it hurt.Her reactions merited a few visits to the ER; one 4 days after the vaccine, in which each time they reasoned her symptoms away as a flu like symptom and didn’t think she had meningitis because she lacked some of the symptoms. I mentioned she had the MMR vaccine 4 days prior, so how could she have meningitis and they didn’t really answer me. It made me curious so upon a follow up the next morning my doctor didn’t really answer my question either, so I asked for some papers to take home to read on it and the shots, since Our son was still in lethargic/sick mode after his and she was very animated about his symptoms being normal. So much so it was overkill and I wasn’t incinerating his was abnormal, (he hadn’t lost his bowels or began any other behavior aside fromSleeping and being generally quiet and zoned out yet at that point).We began reading packet inserts online and I was appalled to see how many adverse reactions there could be. We decided to ask our doc again for information so we could make a rational choice seeing how our 4th son was to be born very soon ( he was born 14 days after their reaction), and one nurse said they had a nurse who dealt strictly with vaccine and medicine questions she’d send in to talk to me, but no one came. The next nurse I asked to remind them to get her looked confused like she had no clue who I was talking about. When my doc came in I asked her and she didn’t confirm there was any nurse and said she had papers I could have. When she came back she said the papers were from a book she forgot she loaned to another patient and hadn’t gotten back, but wasn’t able to tell me the name of it.It was way to many weird situations for us not to thing there was something there. As each kid got worse visits became shorter and no one Brothered to suggest we test anything, they just said it was normal and it happens at the age our son was at. He has since been diagnosed with Autism.Luckily for our newest son he has never been vaccinated and truly is healthy. He hasn’t had ear infections, respiratory issues like our other 3 children had.We read all the way through his first year, saying to ourselves, “ we’ll keep reading a little more then we can always get his vaccines next month after we know everything and can feel comfortable”The more we read the more we had to read more and more, and time just flew by, the literature we read along the way deterring us from vaccinating each time. He is now a year and a half old and runs, jumps off things, says over 40 words and has no allergies.We are happy with our decision and continue to learn as we are recovering our son from Autism with great success using diet, Dr Andy Cutlers Chelation Therapy Protocol and boosting his immune system so far and still weighing opinions for our daughter, who is still being looked at for issues that arose. So far she’s diagnosed with Emotional Disturbance Disorder, has a lot of set backs in her abilities in reading, so much so she’s in the lowest group now in school despite our nightly practice and teachers support. She has had several MRI’s, one of which we were refered to a neurosurgeon to correct nerve damage in her spine from the vaccine; although no one will admit it’s from the vaccine, not on paper anyways. It’s infuriating.Parents should all be informed of their doctors education on vaccine ingredients, reactions, law and vaccine approval processes.If they choose to vaccinate that is their choice, just like it is ours to no longer.Free from bullying, free from judgement, free from ignorance.Attached are images of some of the many books I’ve read that you may also find enjoyable. Emords book is extremely detailed, depressing in explaining specific laws and cases by which they were governed and very eloquent.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R9ZSMCWVFMOXA","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2018","date":{"date":"October 4, 2018","unix":1538611200},"name":"Courtney K.","rating":5,"title":"My illusions were indeed dissolved.

Rintoul","rating":1,"title":"Pseudoscience classic","review":"This book is a classic example of pseudoscience, and thus this review will concentrate on demonstrating that, and pointing out how it could be used as a case study for folks interested in understanding how pseudoscientists manipulate facts to fit their false narrative.What are some of the hallmarks of pseudoscience, and what aspects of this book are good examples? In no particular order; these are:1) A search for a simple answer: Science is intellectually demanding, and understanding the data and its relationship with a conclusion is something that even veteran scientists find to be hard work. In this case the simple answer, sadly aimed at folks seeking answers about the cause for a complex disease like autism, is that vaccines are bad. Wanting a simple explanation for a complex disease, which actually is dependent on many genetic, developmental, and environmental factors, is a valid human urge. Unfortunately, simple answers are rare. Books like this promote simple answers, and although that might be comforting, in the end it can also cause great damage.2) Lies of omission: This is the best tool in the toolbox of pseudoscience, because most folks don't have the deep background to know what is being omitted, and most folks really won't check the references cited. Such errors in scientific articles are usually discovered during peer-review, but books like this are not peer-reviewed, and pseudoscientists rarely if ever publish in peer-reviewed journals. Because this is such an important tool of pseudoscience, I’ll give three examples. I suspect that a close read of the many citations in this book would reveal many more. A) In the chapter on diphtheria, the authors quote from a 1996 article about an outbreak of that disease in St. Petersburg: “If a wide diphtheria epidemic affects and industrialized country, it would probably not any more be the big killer that it was in Europe and in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s.” They imply that the conclusion of the study’s authors is that medical advances other than vaccination stemmed this outbreak, and that vaccines had no effect, because immunity from the vaccine is “short-lived”. However, the sentences IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING that quoted sentence read: “In a subgroup of 1,045 patients the protective efficacy of vaccination could be evaluated. A 2.2 fold protection was found, but the study may underestimate the efficacy.” In other words the authors of that study believe that vaccination is a critical part of stemming that outbreak, that it provides substantial protection from the disease, and that it would be critical in future outbreaks. Selective quotation of a single sentence allows them to argue exactly the opposite of the authors’ conclusions.B) In the chapter on smallpox, the authors spend a lot of time discussing the Leicester Method, where early anti-vaxxers rebelled and refused to get their children vaccinated in that English city. This history is used to suggest that quarantine and sanitation measures alone eliminated smallpox, and that vaccination is useless and even dangerous. Left out of the discussion is the reality that Leicester hospital and medical staff were vaccinated. Many vaccinated people remained in the population. Furthermore, contacts of patients were urged to get vaccinated. So it is a bit more complex than the authors would like us to believe, and the notion that it was ONLY better sanitation and medical treatment does not stand up to scrutiny. This is a classic lie of omission. C) The authors cite a study by Stephen J. Walker, implying that it documents a link between vaccine-derived measles virus and autism. But this study is not as advertised. It is actually not even found in a peer-reviewed article, it is a preliminary report given at a conference. Furthermore Walker himself disagrees with the implication that his results imply a link between measles, vaccines, and pathology. Via his university press office, this misrepresentation is called out. \"Walker says the new research does not support the connection, and he notes that the results have not even been published in a peer-reviewed journal. ‘Even if we showed association (between measles virus and bowel disease) and we published it in a peer-reviewed journal, the conclusion will be simply that there is measles virus in the gut of a large number of children who have regressive autism and bowel disease. End of story.’\"3) Allegations of massive problems with current science, documented by massive citation lists: In creationism circles (creationism is another good example of pseudoscience) this is known as the Gish Gallop, after Duane Gish, who often moved so quickly from one bogus argument to the next that his opponents had no time to counter the first one. One example should suffice. Among the many irrelevant graphs and images in this book, there is a photo of a mosquito dying from DDT. Even if there was a lot of evidence that DDT was a problem in the polio epidemic (there isn’t), this image really doesn't add much to the vaccine argument. This makes the book longer and perhaps makes it appear more \"sciencey\" to a lay audience, but serves no useful scientific purpose. If confined to the simplest and most concise arguments needed to make their case, the authors might have produced a book less than 10% the length of this one.4) Correlation conflated with causation: There are dozens of examples in the book, including the aforementioned correlation of DDT and polio cases, most of the graphs, etc. Simple graphs of disease mortality vs. time are appealing to non-scientists, but the reality is that these unsophisticated bivariate analyses of events with many confounding variables are neither helpful nor explanatory.5) Setting up a false dichotomy: The authors strenuously argue, in many chapters, that sanitation, not vaccination, can explain decreases in incidence and mortality of many diseases. There is no consideration that both sanitation AND vaccination might be important, and that both are effective. They state, correctly, that medical doctors could have prevented lots of deaths by washing their hands. That is certainly true, but so what? Has someone claimed that there is only one medically valid way to save lives? Or is it possible that sanitation is just one of many useful advances? Ditto with the arguments about nutrition. As noted above, the simple answer is always preferred; complicated answers, which recognize a complicated reality, will be discarded by pseudoscientists and thus will never occur to their readers.6) Personal subjective anecdotes and testimony are emphasized over objective evidence from many subjects and many studies: This is not as obvious with this book as it often is, but nonetheless both authors write, in the author's introduction section, about personal experiences that drove them on this quest. That's fine. But we all know that anecdotes ain't data.7) Misrepresenting the facts: Besides the harder-to-detect lies of omission, careful research will always find some outright whoppers in the arguments of pseudoscientists. In the chapter about polio vaccines, some early versions of which were contaminated by a monkey virus known as SV40, the authors claim that \"SV40 is known ... to induce tumors when injected into volunteers\". In support of this assertion, they cite an article from 1964 (ref. 468). However, that article does NOT report the production of tumors after viral injection, contrary to the statement made by the authors of this book. The article does describe the formation of nodules after injection of various amounts of transformed human cells (NOT live virus) into terminal cancer patients; these nodules do not progress to become tumors, but instead regress and disappear. In the one case where a patient is injected with virus, as a control, no nodules or even a reaction occurs. Nobody reading that article could legitimately claim that it showed that injection of live SV40 produces tumors in human beings. Yet that is the claim made in this book.8) Pointing out problems without mentioning that these problems were DISCOVERED by scientists who want to solve them: Vaccines, like all medicines, are imperfect, particularly in their first versions. These imperfections were discovered by other scientists (not by pseudoscientists like the authors of this book) and, in fact, other scientists have taken steps to use that information to make vaccines better. Case in point - Adenylate Cyclase Toxin from B. pertussis is known to be a major immunogen in patients who are naturally infected, and is now being engineered to be a component of next generation vaccines. The authors make a big point that this lack of a major immunogen in current vaccines is a problem, but fail to acknowledge that actual working scientists found the problem and are actively striving to correct it. Science solve problems; pseudoscience merely points them out and pretends that science stopped there.9) Conspiracy theories based on \"big science\" or \"big pharma\" or other nebulous groups who are somehow covering up the truth: Again, one example (out of many) should suffice. The authors mention the article by Andrew Wakefield that started this whole recent anti-vaccine industry, and assert that it was retracted \"without explanation\", in a \"bizarre move\". No, it was retracted after an investigation by the British General Medical Council found that Wakefield had \"acted dishonestly, irresponsibly, unethically, and callously in connection with the research project and its subsequent publication\". He had a disqualifying conflict of interest that was not disclosed. Later, it was shown that he had falsified some of the data. Additionally, despite many subsequent efforts to detect a link between vaccines and autism, none have been found. That's how science works; conflicts of interest, outright fraud, and lack of reproducibility are signs that the conclusions of the paper are incorrect. It can only be considered \"bizarre\" if you subscribe to pseudoscience rather than science, and believe in conspiracy theories. The notion that there is a global conspiracy to hide the truth is laughable to anyone who is a scientist, and who understands how competitive science actually is. If a scientist figured out a way to overturn a paradigm, or, even better, advance human health, he/she would immediately do so, and the notion that some vague international cabal could keep them from that is not only dubious, it is insulting to every real scientist on the planet.10) Invoking irrelevant bogeymen: Pseudoscientists know their audience, and understand that the mere mention of particular words or names will make that audience associate the evil person or concept with the evil that they are decrying. So these authors trot out Charles Darwin and evolution, as well as Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood, and Hitler and Nazism, secure in the knowledge that their audience hates those people and those words, and will therefore automatically be suspicious of any concept, no matter how irrelevant, that they can link, no matter how tenuously, to those bogeymen. Darwin, Sanger and Hitler had nothing to do with vaccines or vaccination, but that is not the impression that the authors would like you to retain.In closing, it is good to quote the epigram for chapter 16, from Daniel Boorstin \"The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance - it is the illusion of knowledge.\" Truer words were never spoken; this entire book is the illusion of knowledge, and it is an obstacle to discovery. The simple easy answers sought by many are not found in this book, and accepting its arguments without deeper investigation will only set up more obstacles to understanding and discovery. A good antidote to this ignorance would be to read Seth Mnookin’s “The Panic Virus”, in order to actually gain the knowledge needed to dissolve the illusions created by the half-truths in this book.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RSR09XNDB2QWM","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2018","date":{"date":"March 17, 2018","unix":1521248400},"name":"Karl","rating":5,"title":"I liked the depth of the research reviewed in this book","review":"I liked the depth of the research reviewed in this book.Dr. Humphries walks us through the history of vaccinations right up to modern day.I wish I had read it before I had children, however, I will be gifting it to those I love who will be having children in the future.Happy St. Patrick's Day.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R40IHLFNWR6C6","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2018","date":{"date":"March 13, 2018","unix":1520902800},"name":"spicymomma","rating":5,"title":"Fantastic and well-researched book!","review":"Dr. Humphries is a physician who woke up to the realities of the control of the pharmaceutical industry has over medical education and training.

And in fact, half of the veterinarian, in Denmark, are talking against vaccination. But my Thai wife, wanted it to be vaccinated, as the animal doctors told her so.And now, after having read this book I have totally cleared out my knowledge about vaccination, that is only to accept to be vaccinated after having read a given actual vaccination to be absolutely necessary.By reading in the book we realize how much truth about vaccination, we during time have been missing, and this quite opposite to how we again and again have been told that vaccines cured the diseases.And according to the normal strategy in start selling of a new item it looks rather strange here to read how the vaccine against Measles actually first was put into use when the dead by this disease had fallen to only 00.04% of when it once had been highest.And for many of the other diseases it had fallen by more than 90 % when the vaccines were put in use. Why not just wait and see if these actually declines would continue, or just realize that the decline ought to be caused by the increase in the healthier foot, settlements, and so on, which had come.In connection to the health, it’s highly interesting in the start of the book to read, and see the historical pictures, about how badly especially the working class lived there in the beginning of the industrialization era.And it’s strange to read how, among other, especially the gold miners very suffering from scurvy, without knowing it, because they didn’t get fruits containing vegetables or fruits, and thereby getting vitamin C. And I recalled a silent film with Chaplin in which he together with another person at sitting and eating and getting soup made by their leather boots.All together has the book changed my idea about vaccination.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2N7OXWKEQ1WAO","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2017","date":{"date":"November 24, 2017","unix":1511485200},"name":"Hailey","rating":5,"title":"Great Book","review":"Great Book filled with a lot of knowledge.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3URWUX22G15P3","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2017","date":{"date":"November 16, 2017","unix":1510794000},"name":"Rachel W.","rating":5,"title":"Wonderful book!

This book is absolutely a testament to the sheer ignorance, negligence, and evil inside the system of allopathic \"medicine\"...it's chapter after chapter of mind-blowing atrocities.Even with all of that, it is also a beautiful account of the life (to this point) of a broken soul who found Jesus and truth all at the same time. Her testimony of accepting Christ is surely to aide in bringing others to The Lord...I have no doubt many that read it will become Believers. 💗I am so elated to know that such a warrior is taking charge in the world of holistic & functional medicine.

He told me he was going to prevent his child from getting any vaccines. None. I thought he was insane, and then was very mad at him. I expressed many of the common arguments regarding herd immunity, etc.. So he gave me this book and said before I argue with you about this, read it, then come back and let's talk.Previously, I had heard of the debunked thimerosal studies being used as a case for autism and had done a little research on them out of curiosity. I was unconvinced there was any link with thimerosal and autism, given the removal (in large part) of the preservative from US vaccinations years ago and with no decrease in autism diagnoses. Regardless, I began reading it because of the promise I had made to my friend.It is 4 weeks later, I'm nearly done reading the book a second time and am thinking of quitting my job to pursue full-time righting the wrongs described in this book. In short- it has changed my life. I have read a couple of other dissenting books in the meantime, some of the studies mentioned in the book, etc. and I am convinced this is the single biggest medical blunder ever perpetrated on humanity. 4 weeks ago I was reluctant to read a quack-science book like this, and now here I am trying to figure out a way I can make a difference in revealing the vaccination lie.So reader be ware, if you have an open mind. If you don't have an open mind, go ahead and read it- no harm will come to you. You will make yourself believe the numbers are wrong, or the data has been fudged. Anything to prevent the cognitive dissonance this book might otherwise create.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1FH4X6Y2YXAIQ","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2015","date":{"date":"November 2, 2015","unix":1446426000},"name":"M.

Usually I get to the 15th - 20th negative review when I can qualitatively generalize the predominant complaint or common attribute of the critical population.For example, with a masticating juicer I am researching, I've noticed that critical reviewers hadn't read the proper cleaning instructions of the device, thus the most common complaint is one specific \"failing\" part.Now I REALLY want the juicer, because I have deduced that even the negative reviews are mostly positive ones, so long as you are able to read instructions and apply what you've learned... which a lot of folks seem to struggle with.I think this book is another clear example that this methodology is a best practice for finding a great book; it is a superb literature review of research that busts the \"safe and effective\" mantra.The critical reviewers are obviously taking to the comment postings with something to prove, or possibly dont understand literature review/what the book is intended to achieve, or are unconsciously defending their own irreversible parenting choices.If the question is \"Did the authors provide a central location for threading together years of information that you'll never otherwise experience?\"Then my five-star answer indicates : \"Absolutely.\"Also, I have spoken to Dr. Humphries recently in a 2 hour wellness consult.I have never in my life been treated so respectfully.She truly is a wealth of knowledge and she will answer any questions you have about the book.If you are truly using this text to make a decision about whether or not to vaccinate your kids, I would suggest printing/copying what you find to be the \"most well-grounded\" critical reviews here, and address them with her directly via a consult.She will not get defensive and she will speak to you like a human being... which is a lot different than your local physician.Good luck getting more than 5 minutes with that doctor, and if they don't laugh in your face--that's a \"success.\"If you actually read my entire review--> I hope your decisions and chosen path, whatever they may be, work out for the best for you and for your family. <3","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R180ID3CZXERM2","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2016","date":{"date":"January 1, 2016","unix":1451610000},"name":"Lawrence Ambrose","rating":5,"title":"Great Book For Those Interested In The Truth About Vaccines","review":"The perfect book for those wishing to dig beneath pharmaceutical brochures - and the cheer-leading commentary of politicians and scientists who've been bought and paid for - to the truth about vaccines.A truly fascinating and well-argued presentation by the author.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1AR5F3HFURJH8","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2015","date":{"date":"December 20, 2015","unix":1450573200},"name":"Laura Bellefontaine","rating":5,"title":"deep read, and wonderful","review":"This is a must read.

If you have even a slightly open mind and are not a paid shill or on the dole of the 'seed media', you should find this book a treasure trove. Dr. Humphries delves into the history of vaccines, but she also digs into what life was really like for people in the 'good ol' days'. She shows how they lived and what they lived in (hovels, holes in the wall with no heat, no sanitation and no decent food). She shows all of the nasty filth and garbage that these poor people lived in with no public sanitation. No wonder they were always sick and died so early! She not only goes into the history of what life was like, but also lifts the crusty lid of what the 'vaccine science' was like during that day. This is what probably makes the drug pushers and pharma companies cringe, as they were very biased in their reporting as well as classification of diseases. She also goes into how people would 'cure' their supposed 'incurable' diseases!As one who has cured myself from 'incurable' diseases, I am grateful for her advice on how to go about keeping your immune system healthy so it won't end up getting sick.

She gives a chilling account of what life was like prior to modern advances in sanitation, nutrition (specifically food safety), and hygiene (personal, industrial, and medical). Her graphs show indisputably that all the dread diseases, which we have pronounced eradicated by vaccines, were in significant decline prior to vaccine development, introduction, and widespread use. I encourage all free-thinking people interested in the true \"science\" of disease prevention to give this a read. Real scientists know that it is always good to question the accepted knowledge, to test it rigorously and demand it be tested. They also know that untampered data doesn't lie: diseases were on the way down sharply prior to vaccines. It is quite possible that vaccines provide some protection from disease in some individuals who produce a proper immune response. It is reality that they are not 100% effective and that effects frequently wane. It is a reality that they injure and kill others who are susceptible to components, who receive \"hot lots,\" and whose immune system doesn't respond in the desired manner. Vaccine science will forever be impeded until we can acknowledge the dangers as well as the benefits.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R302HMS0YAGWNR","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2015","date":{"date":"June 27, 2015","unix":1435363200},"name":"D.

Wolinsky","rating":5,"title":"Unethical Doctors and Quick-Fix Patients","review":"The world has always had a love-hate relationship with medicine. On one hand, some people will try any procedure to cure illnesses, but on the other, many are afraid of the doctors. I imagine that when Smallpox inoculation came about, a sizeable number of men would’ve said “I’m not dumb enough to go looking to get Cowpox!” Physicians have always been respected in the USA, but the Tuskegee Experiment didn’t endear them to African Americans in the South. A recent book called The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks shows how the problem was even worse than it looked.Humphries and Bystrianyk, a physician and a medical researcher, not only tell the story of the vaccine controversy, but also show that lack of ethics practiced by the doctors. Take the chapter on Smallpox vaccine; the doctors did all of their experiments on children, which today would be totally unacceptable. In some ways, the book makes vaccine look like a reckless-quack-cure-all to deal with the poor. In the chapter The Rebel Experiment, we see how the authorities in Leicester used hygiene as opposed to vaccine. The outbreaks of Smallpox were occurring in the slums, which were crowded, badly-ventilated and filthy. The best way to fight the disease was to move the infected to isolation wards, clean the apartments, and air them out.The book continues to discuss the problems of “quick fixes” for health problems; DDT, questionable Polio treatments (and diagnosis), along with lack of proper diets. During the Polio epidemic, which often occurred in summer, DDT may have been responsible for damaging immune systems. There’s even a chapter on old remedies, many of which do in fact work. I remember how my grandfather used to make his kids (and grandkids) take cod liver oil every day in the 1950’s. It tasted horrible (even in pill form) but it worked. Cod liver oil contains essential vitamins, and is a known immune-booster.I get the feeling, after reading this book, that Americans use medicine as a quick fix so they can avoid having to work at it. We give our kids vitamins to compensate because we can’t get them to eat greens. Then we give behaviorally-challenged kids Ritalin to keep them quiet, rather than use sports and outdoor recess. Just like in the 1800’s, when London’s authorities would rather use Cowpox-based vaccine rather than provide clean water, we tend to look for easy cures.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3I247MKVBAHDA","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2015","date":{"date":"September 18, 2015","unix":1442534400},"name":"Ben","rating":5,"title":"For your kids or future kids, read this book.","review":"I admire the writers for their clear, readable style and detailed, cited references.Dr. Humphries has that rare ability for a professional scientist to be able to communicate clearly with the lay public.If you are concerned about your health or the health of your children, then read this book.It reminds me of what a friend said to me once, \"I need protection from the people who claim to be protecting me.\"The political issue is about personal freedom and choice, not \"herd immunity\".She clearly explains what genuine, natural \"herd immunity\" actually is.So why do we accept that these invasive procedures forced on the public?Hey, if you believe in vaccines, fine, go ahead and vaccinate yourself and your kids, but do not force this on me and mine.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R348XFDZJQ343V","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2015","date":{"date":"September 7, 2015","unix":1441584000},"name":"pam","rating":5,"title":"A very important read BEFORE you let your children be vaccinated.","review":"Excellently researched by a competent physician.

I responded to that review, but felt that those April 13 comments were so off-the-mark and misleading-- while giving the appearance of a rigorous scientific review-- that the response to those comments deserved a review in itself. Hence the current review. I will take Isabella's negative comments point-by-point. The reviewer's original points--statements she attributes to Humphries-- are in uppercase text. My opinion of the Humphries book is that it's well-researched and accurate and backed up by published research, and that the reviewer severely distorted the facts presented in the book.CLAIM 1: THE MEASLES VACCINE CAUSES ILLNESSThe reviewer asserts that Dr. Humphries says that the measles vaccine causes illness, and states that Humphries used an outdated paper from 1967 to confuse and mislead readers. However, it is very clear from the outset of that section (beginning on page 347) that Humphries is talking about an early version of the measles virus, and is referring to “the history you may not know about.” The reviewer is misleading when she states that Humphries asserts that “the measles vaccine causes illness”: that is not what she says. Humphries does say that there have been documented cases of aseptic meningitis and serious neurological diseases after measles vaccination and two of her references are from years 2002 and 2008.CLAIM 2: MEASLE VACCINATION DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST ALL STRAINS.Technically, the reviewer might be right that this isn’t true (I don’t know,) but what we do know is that there have been many documented cases of measles outbreaks in fully-vaccinated populations. For example, the NEJM in 1987 had a paper on a “Measles Outbreak in a Fully-Immunized Secondary School Population.” In 1998, there was a measles outbreak in a highly vaccinated population in Anchorage, Alaska; in 1996, an outbreak occurred among a highly vaccinated population in Toronto; and so on.Humphries’ main point that measles vaccines may not protect against measles is in fact true.CLAIM 3: ANTIBODIES ARE USELESS. I can’t find the reference quote anywhere on page 389, or in nearby passages.In context, however, what Humphries is saying is that antibodies have been shown to be sometimes unnecessary in fighting diseases, and she cites the example of children with congenital agammaglobulinaemia, who could make no antibody but nevertheless recovered from measles and also, remarkably, seemed immune to further attacks (p 364.) Humphries cites references for this. So the claim is not that antibodies are useless; the claim is that maybe we don’t know as much about antibodies as we thought. The reviewer is distorting Humphries’ position.CLAIM 4: ANTIBODIES ARE HARMFUL. I refer readers to pages 366-369 of Humphries’ book, where you can read for yourselves how the reviewer’s take on Humphries’ position is a distortion of what Humphries actually says. Humphries isn’t saying antibodies are harmful; she is pointing out documentation that shows how antibodies can sometimes confuse cellular mechanisms, and the main point is that we really don’t fully understand how immunity works with regards to the measles vaccine, and in fact we see many instances of the failure of that vaccine, as I pointed out above in “claim 2” comments.CLAIM 5: THE MEASLES VACCINE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECLINE IN THE DISEASE.As the reviewer knows from reading the book, polio is an instance where a change in criteria for diagnosis must have had a significant, but unacknowledged, effect on incidence. The criteria changed from paralysis for 24 hours to paralysis for 60 days, and we don’t know how many cases were “wiped out” by this change in diagnosis in 1955. With measles, as with most vaccines, once a vaccine comes out the diagnostic criteria are often tightened, and in addition doctors will be reluctant to call cases “measles” if they know there is a vaccine against the measles—this is just human nature and isn’t unreasonable or fraudulent.The vaccine probably did decrease measles, but to what extent is unclear. We do know that mortality from measles fell precipitously long before the vaccine came online.CLAIM 6: RASHLESS MEASLES LEADS TO DEGENERATIVE DISEASEThe reviewer implies that Humphries is wrong because she cites a paper that deals with immunoglobulin and not vaccines. However, the point Humphries is making concerns the mechanism that is common to both rashless measles that may be acquired through vaccination or through treatment with immunoglobulin, and that involves the interference with cellular immunity mechanisms(an incomplete immune response.) From the same Lancet paper the reviewer references, Humphries excerpts a quote: “immunization performed while antibody is present may induce long-term suppressive effect.” So the paper, contrary to what the reviewer asserted, does address vaccination. CLAIM 7: BREAST MILK OFFERS SUPERIOR PROTECTION AGAINST MEASLES COMPARED TO THE VACCINEThe reviewer states that Humphries got the paper cited (Silfverdale 2009) backwards. But the study does, in fact, assert that breast-feeding can offer protection up to age ten. Table 1 in the paper says that 31.2% of those vaccinated later got the measles, whereas only 8.4% of those breastfeed longer than three months got measles. This data supports Humphries’ interpretation. The conclusion of the paper is not, in my opinion, stated clearly, and may lead to some confusion.CLAIM 8: THE MEASLES VACCINE LEADS TO HIGHER INFANT MORTALITYThe correct page number for the reference is page 393. In this section Humphries is making the point that vitamin A is depleted by measles, and as an example she cites a study in which there was a higher mortality associated with a higher titer measles vaccine. This higher mortality was likely due to vitamin A depletion of the higher, as compared to the lower, titer vaccine—according to the study. Humphries was not saying that the measles vaccine leads to higher infant mortality, and to say that she was is to grossly misconstrue this section. And BTW the quote here, which the reviewer attributes to Humphries, was from the authors of the study in question.Dr. Humphries’ book should be required reading for every physician in the country, and for every parent concerned that what the vaccine authorities are telling us may not be the truth.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2X4U2WMNHAMPM","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2015","date":{"date":"August 13, 2015","unix":1439424000},"name":"Melissa","rating":5,"title":"EVERY Doctor/Nurse/Medical Student should be required to read this","review":"Eye opening revelations in this book.

It's common knowledge that vaccines greatly reduced or eliminated most infectious diseases that ravaged populations during the 19th century and into the first half of the 20th century… or so we are told.According to the authors of Dissolving Illusions, vaccines played a very minimal role in the reduction of infectious diseases. But why then would nearly everyone, including most medical doctors, be so much in favor of vaccines? Therein lies a fascinating story. Truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction!Author Dr. Suzanne Humphries was a very highly paid MD (as a kidney specialist) in a hospital, and for years was in synch with the hospital's pro-vaccine agenda. But then she began see problems in some of her patients that seemed to be connected to their vaccines. Her attempts to do something about this were brushed off by the hospital authorities. This eventually led to her voluntary resignation in 2011. She spent the next few years doing full-time research of the scientific literature and on the history related to vaccines. She then began to teach the shocking truths she had discovered, bucking threats and being called a \"quack\" in the process.Coauthor Roman Dystrianyk is a father of three children. He had researched vaccines and tried unsuccessfully to convince his wife that they were unsafe. She was a nurse who sided with the medical authorities. She had their kids vaccinated with multiple shots all in one visit, without Roman's knowledge. All three kids got sick and Roman found out what had happened. This led him to do much further research.It is apparent that money was a not a motivator for either Suzanne or Roman. (However, as we can see from other sources, money in the multi-billions is likely a motivator for the vaccine industry. And there is evidence of enormous conflicts-of-interest within and between Big Pharma, the CDC, FDA, and academia.)The formatting of this book is brilliant. Generally throughout we have a few paragraphs of authors' commentary followed by a supportive brief excerpt from an authoritative source (all sources identified), a bit more commentary, another referenced excerpt etc. This makes for enjoyable easy reading and maximum comprehension. Photos and graphs are appropriately inserted.The book starts with an overview of what life was like in \"The Not So Good Ol' Days,\" (1700s and 1800s). Life was much harder than many of us can imagine. Disease was common, life spans were shorter.Crude inoculations against Smallpox were used in the 1700s and through the1800s. Death rates remained high despite periods of mandatory vaccination until sanitation measures began to be employed in the late 1800s. The Smallpox story is discussed in great detail.Most infectious diseases declined markedly in the late 1800s and especially during the early decades of the 1900s before vaccines had even been invented for most to them. This was due to vast improvements in sanitation, sewage systems, better water, plumbing, the gasoline engine enabling trucking and better transportation, electricity, better farming and nutrition, refrigeration, and higher standard of living.The polio story is especially intriguing. Pictures of people encased in iron lungs and kids wearing braces hooked people emotionally. (I was 12 years old in 1954 when the Salk Vaccine was announced and I still remember the jubilation in my school.) Eventually reports of vaccine success against polio were reported. But research of the facts reveals that this was due to fudging of statistics and changing disease definitions to give the appearance of success.A modern version of the iron lung is still with us which is called a ventilator. It is a much smaller and far less dramatic-looking device for treating cases of breathing paralysis stemming from \"transverse myelitis\" – which still occurs, and which results from many possible causes usually NOT related to the polio virus, but which would historically have been generalized as \"polio.\"Seventy pages of the book are devoted to the very complex and twisted story of the supposed \"disappearance\" of polio. The bottom line is that the wild polio virus itself was never as serious a threat as was assumed. Polio vaccines (Salk and Sabin) did much more harm than good for several reasons – the authors explain how so in detail. By the way, Franklin Roosevelt probably did not have polio, but Guilain-Bair syndrome (GBS).The story of vaccines against whooping cough (pertussis) is also involved and dramatic, as is the measles story, both of which are covered in detail.The authors explain why \"herd immunity\" for most diseases (if any) cannot be achieved through vaccinations no matter how high the percentage of people vaccinated. It is clear that vaccines in general are not nearly as effective as the authorities claim, and they are far more dangerous than is generally believed.The final chapter is on \"Belief and Fear\" – fear of disease leading to reliance on those considered to be knowledgeable authorities. Hopeful thinking along with big money have had much to do with the \"authorities\" becoming conditioned to believe the mythology of \"safe and effective\" vaccines. The effectiveness of the vaccine approach has long been greatly exaggerated, the science corrupted, and vaccine risk \"continuously denied and underplayed.\" We humans have the ability to deceive ourselves, especially when fear or money is involved.Dissolving Illusions is a wonderful tool for educating people on the truth regarding vaccines.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1Q08Y287AAFJG","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2015","date":{"date":"April 19, 2015","unix":1429401600},"name":"Pill","rating":5,"title":"Wish our Congress would read this book","review":"A must read if you want an informed opinion about this subject","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1365HJLTWDFZI","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2015","date":{"date":"April 19, 2015","unix":1429401600},"name":"Richard Sacks","rating":5,"title":"This book is so important at this time, no words can describe.","review":"This book tells the real history of vaccines.They have never prevented ANY diseases, but have started and spread many epidemics.Also look up \"Lethal Injection, the story of vaccination\" on youtube, which is a very important documentary on vaccines that tells the truth that we are absolutely not supposed to know.I have been an independent holistic health scientist/consultant for 50 years and I can tell you that most of the disease and hellish aging that is the legacy of the drug-centered medical system is totally unnecessary and abnormal.The real health knowledge is forbidden and hidden from the people in America, and health free speech is severely limited.Now they are getting ready to try to force vaccines on everyone, which will further decimate health.This is not how the body gets immunity!I will answer questions as time allows richard@globalleadersconsulting.com.

A homeopath recommended I read \"Dissolving Illusions\" before making a decision. However, the more I delved into the book the more I was disappointed. Dr Humphries is extremely black-and-white in her views, and this leads her to resort to half-truths, strange twists of logic and at times outright deception to support her claims. Here are a few examples of the tactics she uses based on her measles chapter as basis:CLAIM 1: THE MEASLES VACCINE CAUSES ILLNESSShe says, \"A study from 1967 revealed that the vaccine could cause pneumonia as well as encephalopathy (p 347)\".However, the study she cites as proof [1] talks about the inactivated measles vaccine which was only used in the US from 1963 to 1967 (and never introduced in most other countries). Why would she cite data numerous times throughout that chapter on an outdated vaccine, unless she is deliberately trying to confuse and mislead readers? In the 1967 study in question, the measles vaccine was found to be ineffective and some children caught the wild form of measles 5-6 years later and suffered measles complications such as pneumonia and encephalopathy.CLAIM 2: MEASLES VACCINATION DOES NOT PROTECT AGAINST ALL STRAINSOn page 355 Dr Humpries states, \"Thirteen million doses of measles vaccine are injected each year. Those live viruses are attenuated, and the strains will vary from time to time in the manufacturing process, which means that immunity to one strain does not necessarily confer immunity to wild virus or to future virus.\"This is untrue and can be easily looked up. While there are 19 \"genotypes\" of measles, there is only one \"serotype\". In other words, antibodies against one genotype will protect against all other genotypes, which is why measles immunity is typically considered lifelong.CLAIM 3: ANTIBODIES ARE USELESSDr Humphries believes that antibodies play a mere questionable role in the body’s immune system:\"People without antibodies can be completely protected from clinical illness by cellular immunity. Therefore antibody is a mere surrogate that has questionable significance\" (p 389).While it is true that other immune mechanisms kick into place when an individual suffers from compromised antibody production, this does not mean that antibodies are useless in otherwise healthy individuals. In fact, if you read the study she cites as proof [2] it stresses numerous times the importance that antibodies play in fighting an infection like measles. It also describes that both antibody and cellular immunity are needed when responding to the live virus in the measles vaccine, which other studies have measured. [3] Dr Humphries seems to think that the measles vaccine only stimulates one type of immunity (antibody immunity), but this is untrue (see [3] below).CLAIM 4: ANTIBODIES ARE HARMFULNext, Dr Humphries goes on to say that antibodies are not only useless, but in fact harmful:“It is a little-known fact that any antibody, even a vaccine-induced one, can render a person more vulnerable to disease […] Some antibodies increase the ability of viruses to infect their target cells. This phenomenon is called antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection (p 367).”When I looked up the \"ADE phenomenon\" I found that it has only been observed in relation to the particular characteristics of the dengue fever virus and HIV virus. It is not a phenomenon that relates to the viruses we currently vaccinate against — measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, rotavirus and influenza. Why bring up ADE when it has nothing to do with vaccine viruses, and especially the measles virus?CLAIM 5: THE MEASLES VACCINE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECLINE IN THE DISEASEIf you look at the data that is available [4], the measles vaccine brought with it a tremendous 98% drop in measles cases in the US in a matter of a few years. However, Dr Humphries argues that doctors merely changed their diagnostic criteria shortly after the introduction of the vaccine.Her assertions implies that 1) physicians in the 1960s who were intimately familiar with measles suddenly became incompetent at diagnosing it, and / or 2) all doctors were wrapped up in a global scam to \"hide\" disease notifications and give the vaccine a semblance of effectiveness where there was none. This is where her views essentially boil down to a large scale intergovernmental conspiracy theory.CLAIM 6: RASHLESS MEASLES LEADS TO DEGENERATIVE DISEASENext, she implies that \"rashless\" measles leads to degenerative disease later in life citing a 1985 Lancet paper. [5] This paper is access restricted. However, when I paid the $35 to see the full report it had nothing to do with vaccines. It was a historical study looking at individuals born in Copenhagen and Gentofte in the pre-vaccination era — specifically 1941 and 1947. It found that individuals who had contracted the wild form of measles, while treated with passive antibodies (eg. immunoglobulin treatment which was common at the time), did not manifest a rash and had a higher incidence of degenerative diseases later on in life. Since the measles vaccine does not confer passive antibodies (like the scenario studied above), but rather stimulates your body to produce its own active immune response in response to the live virus, well-timed measles vaccination can actually reduce the risks of degenerative disease, as this very same study states at the end:\"Measles can be controlled by large-scale vaccination, and where this is employed successfully the frequency of non-measles associated disease should be considerably reduced.\"CLAIM 7: BREAST MILK OFFERS SUPERIOR PROTECTION AGAINST MEASLES COMPARED TO THE VACCINENext, Dr Humphries claims:\"Medical literature suggests that the lower risk of contracting clinical measles after being breastfed can last up to 10 years. When Silfverdale evaluated thousands of vaccinated and unvaccinated breastfed and non-breastfed children looking at the risk of measles, breastfeeding had a far larger impact on measles risk than vaccinating.\" (p 389)However, when I consulted the actual study [6], it did not claim that breastfeeding protection lasted up to 10 years and in fact concluded that breast feeding played a very minor role in protecting against measles infection compared to the vaccine:“Immunization against measles provides effective protection against the disease. A more modest reduction in the risk of a measles diagnosis is associated with breast-feeding.”I do not understand why Dr Humphries cites studies that completely oppose her claims, unless she is banking on complacency of her readers.CLAIM 8: THE MEASLES VACCINE LEADS TO HIGHER INFANT MORTALITYNext, she claims:\"Measles vaccine has been associated with other unexpected adverse findings in long-term studies. In developing countries, the use of high-titre vaccine at 4–6 months of age was associated with an unexpectedly high mortality in girls by the age of 2 years from infectious childhood illness.\" (p 395)I encourage you to consult the actual study she cites as proof [7]. The study compared the effectiveness of the high-titre versus standard-titre measles vaccine in West Africa, using mortality rates as the comparative metric. It found that the standard-titre vaccine was simply more effective in reducing mortality rates, especially in girls.This does not mean that the other high-titre vaccine \"itself\" caused infant mortality. Do you see how she repeatedly twists the facts to support her views?CONCLUSIONThe above are just a few examples. In the end, I think Dr Humphries is her own worst enemy. She is so blinded by her convictions that vaccines are evil that she only reads into studies what she wants to read into them. This hurts her credibility.I think vaccines are a very complicated issue for parents to untangle (it was for me). If you are making a decision on vaccines, I would suggest:• Double-check the actual studies that Dr Humphries cites as \"proof\" throughout her book. Many of them are freely available on Google Scholar. See what they actually say and which bits and pieces Dr Humphries deliberately left out.• Discuss the claims with others online / offline to get a balanced view.• See what other studies and resources say on those topics.Here are the citations from the text above for those who are interested:CITATIONS[1] Fulginiti, Vincent A., et al. \"Altered reactivity to measles virus: atypical measles in children previously immunized with inactivated measles virus vaccines.\" Jama 202.12 (1967): 1075-1080.[2] Permar, Sallie R., et al. \"Limited contribution of humoral immunity to the clearance of measles viremia in rhesus monkeys.\" Journal of Infectious Diseases 190.5 (2004): 998-1005.[3] Ovsyannikova, Inna G., et al. \"Frequency of measles virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in subjects seronegative or highly seropositive for measles vaccine.\" Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology 10.3 (2003): 411-416.[4] Orenstein, Walter A., Mark J.

I read Dr. Robert Sears' \"Vaccine Book\" and decided that there were pro's and con's with vaccines and that they had done good work in getting rid of nasty diseases in the past but that there were rare but disturbing side effects associated as well. So we opted to do a more spread-out schedule and delay or forgo some vaccines altogether. We started in with the same schedule for my second child. Neither of them have had any bad reactions but I would still worry and wonder.My interest in the subject was renewed after a debate with someone recently, and I found this book. I immediately ordered it because of the history and the other reviews saying how everything was backed up with tons of references and citations. I figured, how can we learn anything but from history?It is very detailed, and gets quite technical at times, so I couldn't fully understand all of it. But there is a stunning amount of data and information available for anyone to understand and I couldn't put the book down. I read it in about 5 days, skipping around a little.It is shocking just how much important information is left out of main-stream propaganda on vaccines. For example, \"The Vaccine Book\" I once held in high esteem, makes statements like \"Before vaccines, the measles used to be very serious and many people died from it. Now, hardly anyone gets measles anymore\". So the assumption is made that vaccines saved us from measles, from only two data points- 1) some ambiguous time before vaccines and 2) after vaccines.What is not explained is that deaths from measles had already dropped 90-99% BEFORE the vaccine was ever introduced. And that measles deaths did not suddenly do a nose-dive after the vaccine. This book helps to point out and explain those important gaps. It also points out that other once-serious illnesses that caused many deaths are also virtually unheard of now, even though we never had a vaccine for them (such as scurvy, scarlet fever, and others). Another important point that the book makes is that simultaneous with new vaccines often came a new, much narrower definition of the illness. So any perceived decrease in illness credited to the vaccine was just due to a narrower definition of that illness.It starts with the stories of the Industrial Revolution, how people became suddenly crowded into cities, living in horrible conditions often in window-less rooms, garbage and excrement and dead bodies in the streets, drank water polluted with these things, ate spoiled meat and fish and vegetables (although precious little was eaten at all), drank dirty milk, etc. They often worked 12-16 hour days and from very young ages, sometimes as young as 5 years old. Women worked as well as men, often leaving very young girls to care for their infants. Mothers didn't breastfeed. A large number of families often shared a single toilet. They rarely bathed. Rats were everywhere. Hospitals were sometimes the worst of all- a place where sick people went to die. Women who had their babies in a hospital had a good chance of dying from the physicians' unwashed hands introducing germs into her body. The bodies of people who died at home were sometimes left in their tiny apartments to rot for days before the family scraped enough pennies together to bury them. With these kind of living conditions, it is no wonder so many diseases ran rampant and killed so many. (It's amazing to me that any lived at all!) This is the world that vaccine-enthusiasts are talking about when they say things like measles is a dangerous, deadly disease.This book, alongside a couple others I have read, gives me the confidence to know that vaccines did NOT eradicate horrible illnesses (better hygiene, nutrition, and living and working conditions did that). It also gives hints about Vitamin A and Vitamin C being excellent treatments when one does get very sick.This book contains vital information for every concerned parent or health-care worker. It is also important for those working to improve developing countries, pointing out that they need clean water, a clean living environment, sufficient rest, and sufficient and good quality food to cut down on their diseases not vaccines.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R23V1WET5C71Q7","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2015","date":{"date":"March 17, 2015","unix":1426554000},"name":"lozzamo","rating":5,"title":"One book you have to read in your life","review":"Excellent well referenced book on the TRUTH behind vaccination and disease history.

Supposedly vaccines were one of the few medical miracles, but this book clearly shows the data that proves conclusively that vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases they are supposed to protect us from. All the reductions in deaths from diseases were solved with simple clean water, sewage treatment, improved hygiene, disease reclassification, better diets, garbage disposal, sunlight and air exchange. MOST VACCINES ARE CONTAMINATED and they act on different people differently. Now that we know genes are not fixed, but constantly changing, isn't it time to review the basic science and show how wrong the vaccine approach is? HOW MANY DOSEASES ARE INJECTED INTO A PERSON? iF YOU INJECT SOMETHING HOW DOES THIS SIMULATE AN ATTACK ON THE LUNGS OR ANOTHER PART OF THE BODY SYSTEM? This is laughable that this is called medicine.Taking puss from cow sores and scratching it on the arm of a human, this is Science? Not to mention the use of monkey kidney and other organic matter that could have and HAVE PASSED on other contaminants!Pretty much all of medical science is on the same shaky foundation and the money powers will do ANYTHING not to allow this foundation to crumble. Vaccines, Cholesterol, Chemo and so much more, all of it is a huge money making scam, when one searches the truth and reads the actual reports and looks at the raw data in all these cases these myths fall and fail completely. Do not believe any doctor, your health is worth too much to not be informed. doctors kill more people than all the wars and accidents combined and the vaccines kill more people than they would save. In fact people got so mad at vaccines that they marched in the streets to get rid of them and the laws that demanded their use, because they saw how it maimed and killed their first born, they refused to vaccinate their other children! Dr. Humphries also reveals the vitamins and natural ways to protect one self from diseases. If you want to make informed decisions about the health of your family and especially your children then you need this book, if you want to die by a doctor's hand, then bury your head in the sand and roll the dice.

Clearly a dozen or so of them got together on Dec 30 and 31st and hammered out a series of one-star reviews.... without a doubt these are the words of people who have NOT read this book.Now I have little tolerance for the empty reasoning of the pro-vaccine folks... they offer far more propaganda than proof. There are fully a million kids in the US who have never been vaccinated and yet the CDC absolutely refuses to compare the health outcomes of those who are and those who are not vaccinated. Do you want to know why? I'm pretty certain, they'd go down in flames. RARELY does the media do a fair job of exposing how ineffective the vaccines are, and main-stream media also refuses to take an honest look at the damage they do. Robert Kennedy Jr, Jenny McCarthy, Dr. Wakefield, and Katie Curic are not crazy people, but when Big Pharma wants to defend their territory, they will not hesitate to destroy whole careers and any publication who crosses their line (until retractions are issued).This book is a great place to start if you want to understand anti-vaxxers. I thought I knew a few things before I read it, but I learned something amazing on almost every page. I now proudly stand with the brave folks who stood up to power and ridicule with truth. I am an anti-vaxxer.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1J7BTGHS5MQX8","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2015","date":{"date":"January 24, 2015","unix":1422061200},"name":"NW","rating":5,"title":"it's such an amazing piece of work","review":"Not sure where to even start with this book..it's such an amazing piece of work!Well researched and if anything an amazing piece of historical writing.I think the first thing to consider is how naive and ignorant people are to their own history and past as Americans.People living in 21st century America really don't realize just how disgusting our cities were just 100 years ago.That is probably one of the most important aspects of the book.Americans were living in such squalor and filth it boggles the mind.To think people were still burying their dead in walls in America in the 1900s for example is unreal.I'm only half way through the book and can't put it down.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1P8TW8WRBWZG3","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2015","date":{"date":"January 22, 2015","unix":1421888400},"name":"Rachelle","rating":5,"title":"A MUST READ BOOK!!!","review":"This book is extremely well-written and eye-opening.I feel anyone who is a parent or going into the medical field should read this book.We have all been lied to by the government, doctors, and media about so many \"preventable\" diseases.We were taught to fear them and in response vaccinate our children to \"protect\" them from these diseases.Once you understand the mechanisms behind the diseases, you will realize they shouldn't be feared.Dr. Humphries is extremely intelligent and she has a plethora of resources to back up all of her information.

The revolution is coming. The entire can of medical worms is starting to be exposed. Vaccinations that BRING disease to communities. Killed virus that isn't killed and regenerates to be injected into innocent children. Dr. Humphries gives full credit to Dr Fred Klenner for showing how unnecessry are all the vaccinations and 'immunisations' that cannot match the power of injected vitamin C for protecting against and curing every viral and bacterial infection. This book will, like mine (700 Vitamin C Secrets - and a thousand not so secret for doctors) join the ranks of suppressed information. But the public shows signs of awakening. In the USA the Centre For Disease Control threatens to act like a terrorist organisation with the power to forcibly enter homes, inject whoever it likes, act in any way at all, likepreventing unvaccinated children from going to school; and taking powers to isolate and seal off towns. All this is in the name of \"We Know Better\" Western Medicine ,that by scoffing at vitamin C, imposes heart disease on whole nations. They suppress knowledge of how arterial disease, especially in the young, is easily reversible in many, simply with vitamin C. Dr Humphries will be the most disliked doctor for her honest stand - just as I became the most feared Optometrist in the UK for exposing the corruption of the General Optical Council and the British Medical Association. Everyone should read Dr Humphries well researched description of the problem that faces all of us who want to be healthy and not forcibly injected with spurious substances to make pharmacy wealthy. Ebola is a case in point, much evidence pointing to American workers in Africa as the source of simultaneous outbreaks. Was it being developed as a weapon to make more money. My colleagues COULD NOT MAKE ANYONE IN GOVERNMENT LISTEN to vitamin C curing haemorrhagic fevers. Certainly forcible vaccination is being used now in the West simply to make money. The entire UK Flu programme failed in 2014! But it didn't fail to cost the taxpayer! 3 cheers for Dr Humphries!Oh - I Forgot. The statement by Congressman Percy Priest - after ordering and chairing a full investigation of the vaccine controversy. \"He admitted in 1956 that:...in the previous year (1955) many responsible persons had felt that the public should be spared the ordeal of 'Knowledge about the controversy.'IF WORD EVER GOT OUT THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE HAD ACTUALLY DONE SOMETHING DAMAGING TO THE HEALTH OF AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE TERRIBLE . . . WE FELT THAT NO LASTING GOOD COULD COME TO SCIENCE OR THE PUBLICIF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES WERE DISCREDITED\"So there you have it.

I am also old enough to remember when children regularly got measles, chicken pox, mumps and the like(I had them all). . .and never remember anyone having a serious problem recovering uneventfully.Anyone who listens to the news and reads current articles on advances in medicine has to be aware that there has been a great deal of 'spin' on this issue . . .and one seldom finds any true refutation of this spin except in 'alternative health' articles. As a critical reader, I not only read those articles but look for source documents and read those sources carefully, too. What I find is that there are plenty of small studies supporting Dr Andrew Wakefield's supposedly-discredited findings on an autism,/MMR link . . . and realizing that the majority of funding for such research comes from the very pharmaceuticalindustry which sells these vaccines. That is why there are NO large studies-and why these small studies get buried. There's a major profit motive here-a profit not endangered by valid lawsuits due to the Federal Government shielding them from litigation.One of the first clues-to me-was the continued insistence that modern medicine has increased the human life expectancy by many years. This is supposed to be common knowledge but what most people dont understand is that simply the reduction of infant mortality and childbirth deaths make up most of the increase. The figures are an average of ALL lives. No, your great-great-great-grandfather lived to be well over 45, most likely. You may be surprised to find just how far over 45 yrs! As the family genealogist, I read a lot of historical documents and even a cursory examination of lifespan among those people doesnt show that shortened lifespan: I had a great many ancestors in the 1700-1800s who live to nearly-or more than-100 yrs old. I can also see that some family lines had short lifespans. .apparently heredity plays a large part in this. Some families were also very good at raising a large number of children to adulthood, where otherssuffered the loss of most of their children in infancy. Clearly there are other things going on here-and I suspect that good nutrition and rudimentary sanitation had a great deal to do with it. It certainly wasnt vaccination OR antibiotics.In reading Dr Humphries book, she expounds on infant mortality based on delivery methods and attendant hygiene as part of the cause for better childbirth success. What she says here echoes an obscure sociological article written about the midwives of Northern Michigan before 1900 . . .again, something I was researching for genealogy.She also points out that the dreaded 'iron lung' used for paralysis patients 70 years ago has been replaced by the standard ventilator. Nearly all of us know someone who has needed to be on a ventilator during a hospitalization in recent years-we have never equated it with the 'iron lung'-a much more scary image!!Her numerous charts clearly show that the incidence of the original dread diseases which we are dutifully vaccinating for were already in decline-both in contagion and in strength, before vaccines against them were in use. This is usually the way communicable diseases work: a disease that kills too many of it's victims starves itself out of existence. The usual course of such viruses and diseases is to become weaker over time and for many more people to survive them. This week, after the big scare over Ebola (which, btw, didn't become epidemic in the US because we treated it with quarantine, hygiene and supportive medical care)-is now mutating into a less fatal but likely more infective disease . . .the usual course of such dread diseases. It's spread has been facilitated by poor nutrition, non-existent sanitation and the proliferation of burial customs that keep the dearly departed around the house to continue to infect.In short, this book is well-worth reading. There are a lot of facts here that the average person does NOT know . . including the fact that many of these vaccines can actually spread a form of the very disease being vaccinated against and that past vaccination doesnt actually protect you from it. There are some things that are likely worth the risk of vaccination-such as tetanus and your dog's rabies vaccine. Others likely may protect against childhood diseases-for a time-but the possible bad reaction can affect a child for life. Is it worth it? You decide.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"ROYMKIG3BWDQA","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2015","date":{"date":"February 7, 2015","unix":1423270800},"name":"The Bleeding Pelican","rating":4,"title":"So tired of the propaganda.","review":"I want to say that I read every single 1 star review of this book as of 2/7/15 and am amused and disgusted that not a SINGLE one of them has anything useful or scientific or credible to add to the discussion.I'm sorry but just posting that this book is \"dangerous, anti-vax quackery\" doesn't make it so.Fear mongering is not likely to win you many supporters.

The bias and lack of science in many anti-vaccination books is often so obvious that it’s easy for the pro-vaccinationists to attack them. Other brave doctors, such as Dr. Coleman in the UK and Dr. Mendleson, Dr. Mercola and Dr. Saul in the US have written about the dangers, but it seems that Dr. Suzanne Humphries and Roman Bystrianyk, have finally nailed the issue so clearly that it’s impossible to misunderstand. Although many will try.This book is an outstanding example of unbiased and well researched scientific writing.Dr. Humphries takes care to avoid hyperbole and unreferenced statements. She writes well and is very generous in including quotations from both sides of the debate. These quotations, from real people, breathe life into the history. For those with a desire to see the evidence, the book is full of mortality charts from medical journals and public health archives.I believe the biggest message, repeated throughout the book, is that and huge decline in death from dangerous diseases happened from the 1800s on till today. This likely resulted from clean water supplies, better sanitation, nutritious food, pasteurization and refrigeration, less crowding and laws against pollution of food and rivers and child labour.These disease death rates were often approaching zero when vaccines for them were introduced. Medical science then claimed that the disease had been “wiped out” by the vaccine.The shocking parts of the book show how vaccines, when first introduced, caused spiking of the death rates and how the highly vaccinated populations were and are carriers of the disease.This is exactly opposite to the medical version of what the myth of vaccination is all about. As Dr. Humphries says, these facts are never, ever mentioned by the vaccination camp.The suffering of people, including nurses, being experimented on like laboratory rats, and the imprisonment of fathers and mothers who refused to let their children be vaccinated is horrible to read about and contemplate.At the end of the book, the alternatives to vaccines are discussed such as ascorbate, vitamin A, and a whole list of herbs and foods which helped in the past, such as cinnamon, garlic, jicama, echinacea, fresh juice, cod liver oil and colloidal silver.This book is the answer to all those who talk endlessly about the miracle of vaccination. Considering the financial and career incentives for big pharma, doctors and the media, it will take more that this book to swing the tide, but every brave statement of truth is a powerful thing, that cannot be defeated.The book could be improved by adding meanings of medical terms that pop up everywhere, in parenthesis. The audience is not all at graduate level reading ability.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2F3VGH2HWMG9E","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2014","date":{"date":"November 26, 2014","unix":1416963600},"name":"rbdeli","rating":5,"title":"Count me among those who used to consider the anti-vaccination ...","review":"Count me among those who used to consider the anti-vaccination folks a nutty, cult of dangerous kooks. It all changed about two years ago. One day, I was debating someone who was expressing concerns and doubts over the effectiveness of vaccinations. I immediately brought up the polio vaccine to bolster my case about how important vaccinations were. This led me to do some research on the history of vaccination. I began to unravel some consistent historical data from a number of different websites which shook my confidence in my original, life-long-held position. The more I looked into it the harder it became for me to defend my original position on vaccinations. I became fascinated with what I was learning and began buying various Kindle and iBooks on the topic. I also looked into the rebuttal websites and books. Not one of them appropriately addressed or supported the vaccination side.Dissolving Illusions is the most complete book that I have found on the topic of vaccinations. Suzanne Humphries provides all of the data, history, and side-effects of vaccinations and does so with exhaustive references to back it up. I cannot imagine anyone reading this book with an open mind and heart, and not having serious doubts about the effectiveness and safety of vaccinations.

The authors use quotes from history and many charts and tables with historical data - and everything is referenced and footnoted. Every claim is backed up with proof. I recommend that every parent read this book from cover to cover before deciding whether to vaccinate your children. I did not vaccinate my three children (in the 1980's) and had done a lot of research before choosing that decision - but a lot of my research was based on stories of vaccine-caused ailments and diseases. This book fills in the gaps and gives the story of what really caused infectious diseases to plummet before vaccinations came on the scene.This book also covers the importance of vitamins and other remedies that have been shown to combat many of the diseases that are talked about. This book confirms my belief in our amazing immune systems and how a holistic approach to disease (helping our immune systems to fight disease with safe and natural substances) is the healthier way to go. I so appreciate the authors work in unearthing all of these historical reports and data.Here is my money quote from the book: \"Unfortunately, the flawed belief that vaccines and other medical advances were responsible for this amazing decline [in infectious disease mortality] has dictated how infectious diseases are treated today. Instead of an emphasis on hygiene, nutrition, and appropriate vitamin supplementation, immune system support, and natural remedies, the emphasis is always on costly antibiotics, vaccinations, and other medical procedures. These choices have not been without consequences, as they fight the germs instead of supporting the life force. . . . \"There is more, much more. Get this book and read it and share it with parents. Even if you choose to vaccinate, this will make you truly informed.

It should be required reading for all doctors and nurses that go to school. I am about half way through the Kindle version (which is only 1.99 if you by the book through Amazon) and I haven't even gotten the book yet. Its hard to read in the sense that the amount of suffering that people have gone through in the past few hundred years is incredibly sad. I have a feeling that there is not a happy ending. Which ever side you may be on you still have to read this book. The majority of the book is quotes from medical journals, doctors reports and newspaper articles of the past few centuries. It is one of the most cited books I have ever seen with over 800 citations and their sources. The Kindle version is a great tool for referencing. It makes the information only a click away. I intend to buy more copies and give them to some of my past medical supervisors and professors. Ask them to read it and pass it along up the chain. This information has to be told to the public. The argument for vaccine safety has been going on for over 200 years and there is an abundance of false information that is passed off as mainstream and supposedly reliable. Vaccines are widely known to be the cause of the eradication of several diseases yet these diseases according to vital statistics were almost non existent by the time the shots came out. Clean water, sewage, refrigeration, uncontaminated food and better personal hygiene coincided with the drop in death rates . Not vaccines. Cleanliness and a nutritional diet is key to a strong immune system. Vaccines is what will destroy the true herd immunity from the wild viruses. If we continue on our current path of 100% vaccination we will inevitably crate a pandemic like the world has never seen.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1ITGZW36FN9VN","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2014","date":{"date":"October 16, 2014","unix":1413417600},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"title":"Eye opening, it makes you think and reevaluate.","review":"Eye opening,it makes you think and reevaluate.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RVVR9Z4SNLA42","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2014","date":{"date":"October 9, 2014","unix":1412812800},"name":"Bernhard Nagel","rating":5,"title":"great data, thank you","review":"Well researched, great data, thank you.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R5VIHKLJVN7EE","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2014","date":{"date":"October 5, 2014","unix":1412467200},"name":"Timothy D. Lundeen","rating":5,"title":"If you are going to vaccinate your kids, read this first","review":"Superb, the best book by far on vaccination.The book quotes extensively from original sources and reviews the history of health, illness and vaccination. It makes a compelling case that major illness was cured by nutrition, clean water, garbage collection, and improved standards of living. For example, scurvy, a nutritional disease easily cured by even small amounts of vitamin C, used to kill a fair number of people. Curiously enough, death rates from scurvy closely followed deaths from illness over the last 200 years. But there was no vaccine for scurvy, it was cured by better nutrition -- in the same way that these factors dramatically reduced the death rate from illness, well before any vaccines were introduced.The book talks about herd immunity, and the major fallacy in thinking that vaccination provides herd immunity. The problem is that vaccines do not provide lasting protection for most people (which is why kids need frequent boosters). Because a significant fraction of the population will have lapsed protection, and a significant fraction will not get any protection from a vaccine that doesn't \"take\", you just don't get herd immunity with vaccines.The book lays out the ways in which vaccines are a major factor in autism, ADD/ADHD, learning disabilities, epilepsy, asthma, anaphylactic shock to peanuts and more rarely to eggs, food allergies, chronic low-grade infections, increased risk to infants from measles (because a Mom who doesn't get measles can't pass on her resistance), increased risk as adults for shingles, etc. Not to mention the kids who are permanently disabled or die every year, and the likely connection between vaccination and SIDS. When we were in the hospital after my son was born, we saw a baby go into seizures shortly after getting its Hep B shot, and my sister, an RN, had one of her babies stop breathing after being vaccinated. (She was able to resuscitate him, but that was the last shot any of her kids ever got.)Finally, the risk of death or disability from catching one of the illnesses that are vaccinated for is extremely low, and totally preventable with proper support protocols.Vaccines are a major $30 billion dollar business based on fraud. There are no large-scale studies comparing non-vaccinated kids versus vaccinated ones, or even any studies showing that the current vaccine schedule is safe and beneficial to overall health. The few small-scale studies show that non-vaccinated kids are far healthier.Vaccines put money in your pediatrician's pocket and in the major pharmaceutical company's pockets, all for minimal benefit and significant risk to your children.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1BTBNMSQYOSNL","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2014","date":{"date":"October 1, 2014","unix":1412121600},"name":"koolkat","rating":5,"title":"Everyone who ever has considered receiving a vaccination or consenting ...","review":"Everyone who ever has considered receiving a vaccination or consenting to having a child vaccinated must read this book.It is long past due time that the \"illusion\" created by the would-be science of vaccinology, as preached by health authorities and the vaccine manufacturers, be dissolved and busted.Dr. Humphries is a caring and sincere physician who abandoned a career in tradtional medicine due to vaccination mandates imposed on her patients by the hospital at which she worked and which she discovered placed her patients at extreme risk of medical harm.She chose personal sacrifice and a commitment to the safe practice of medicine over remaining a lackey to the corporate-sponsored health care system that now has assumed control over the practice of medicine in the U.S. today.No one on Earth today has researched this topic as well as Dr. Humphries has.This book will open the eyes of even a healthy skeptic of the genuine value of vaccinations to our health!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R272CR75DYJMPU","asin":{"original":"1480216895","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2014","date":{"date":"September 13, 2014","unix":1410566400},"name":"jcomorote","rating":5,"title":"Five Stars","review":"A great read with lots of quotes from publications of the time.

Dr. Humphries is a board certified nephrologist who bought the vaccine story hook line and sinker. But she is one of the rare physicians with he integrity to question what she was taught when her observations disagree. And disagree they did. Many of her critically ill patients were forced to have vaccines that she did not prescribe and shortly after their vaccinations many of them had serious life threatening complications,She quit her $350K annual salary as a hospital nephrologist to carefully research the history of vaccines. She now earns less than 10% of what she did when she was practicing as a physician because she felt she has a higher calling to warn people about the untold story and hidden history of the vaccination programs starting all the way back to smallpox.One of the consistent justifications for their use is the eradication of smallpox and polio. But after she carefully reviewed the medical literature she uncovered a completely different story that is being promoted today by public health officials and most physicians. About 25% of the book consists of the thousands of references that she has in the book. This is a very carefully researched book.I purchase many items and books and Amazon and value their reviews. They are some of the best on the internet. I just want to warn you that you will see many one star one line comments reviews of this book. They are from a group that call themselves skeptics and are strongly pro vaccine. Sadly they don't have the courage to review any data that conflicts with their beliefs. I can assure you that none of them read the book This is particularly tragic as if they were honest with themselves many would reconsider their position.

Also, you will read about the role of the courageous Sister Kenny who devised a successful treatment for the children with paralyzed limbs which was bitterly opposed by mainstream orthopedic surgeons. You will learn that polio was never really conquered. You may recall the terrifying images of heart lung machines of the 1950's graphically displayed by the March of Dimes polio advertisements in magazines.These are gone.They have been replaced by modern respirators, and polio has been renamed infantile flaccid paralysis.Dr Suzanne Humphries is a board certified nephrologist and a very smart woman.When her kidney patients were thrown into renal failure after routine flu vaccinations administered upon entry to the hospital, her pleas to spare her patients were rebuffed. She had requested that her patients not be vaccinated until hospital discharge.This was the turning point, after which, her colleagues, doctors on staff at the hospital, and administrators regarded her with suspicion, as anti-vaccination.Apparently, that's all it takes to be regarded as a pariah, scorned and outcast-ed.Perhaps this book is a form of revenge, an acute lesson for the mediocre pro-vaccine colleagues who opposed her.If you grew up and live in the US, then you have been indoctrinated to believe vaccination to be effective in the prevention of infectious disease, and to have minimal adverse side effects. Be prepared to have those illusions shattered by this unique book which is a monument of scholarly work on this topic, and deserves multiple re-readings. The care and detail of the documentation is intentional and overwhelming.My congratulations to the authors for a job well done.You might also find interesting, Confessions of a Medical Heretic by Robert S.

I love that it’s not chocked full of medical terms and paragraphs that get wordy and boring. It’s the total opposite, which is why I would recommend it for anyone. And these are the TOP herbs to use and not just a varied assortment of this or that.The book has a nice, simple layout and is a quick read, but I’ve already referenced it a few times in the last several days! It’s clear that the author is extremely knowledgeable, and she included plenty of statistics, even graphs, pros/cons and quality information about the herbs she mentions. The details about each of them are specific and she follows up with where you can get it, the anti-viral properties, proper dosage, etc.I’ve been using essential oils for quite a while and just recently started learning about herbal remedies. I was familiar with a lot of the herbs already (sage, chamomile, lemon balm, ginger and others) but it was interesting to read about cat’s claw, elderberry, red root and several more that I had no clue about!I LOVE that she makes a point to always include possible side-effects and what not to use if you have certain health issues. I especially love that it will clearly state if pregnant/breastfeeding women can or cannot use the herbs. That’s always a big question I have when making DIY gifts for girlfriends or trying to offer some holistic advice when they need it.There are some quick and easy recipes for coughs, flu, and even chickenpox.

Shook is one of the preeminent authorities on herbology, so what he says I will believe.I have the issue with the second half of the sentence.The \"Spanish Flu\", the flu the author is speaking about began in Janurary 1918, so technically World War I, however, it is believed that 50-100 million people succumbed to the disease worldwide, primarily Europe.Maybe the author was talking about United States deaths?Quick fact check and it turns out that only 500,000 to 750,000 of those afflicted succumbed to the Spanish Flu.Any editor worth their salt should have double checked that figure to make sure it was accurate.This was the first major error that I found and I am sure that most people would read on by without taking into account the historical fallacies.So now to the good:I am as I stated a novice herb user and lately I have been reading all I can about herbal remedies to become healthier.I am currently on three medications for the rest of my life and I would like to see if maybe there was a herb that could assist those medications or assist the issue in such a way that I don't have to be on the medications.This book is based on antivirals and while my illnesses are not antiviral, viral illnesses affect me greater than others.As a historian the fact that this author uses cited material, graphs, and other images that strengthen the arguments presented make me glad that I chose this book.A couple of the things that I really found educational and useful is both a breakdown of illnesses that have thought to benefit from herbal remedies, and the herbs themselves.A large portion of the book is dedicated to a herb by herb break down on what works for what.The herb definitions also have when not to use it - pregnant, on certain medication, etc - and how much should be taken for any given reason.The books format is also very user-friendly.With short links to specific herbs and a natural progression from basic knowledge to specific diseases to specific herbs, and then recipes the author leads you through the knowledge in a manner that is easily followed.With 45 different herbs, these are not just the exotic ones, but basic every day herbs like Mint, Sage, and Ginger.The recipes themselves are not just \"here are the herbs, have fun\" but specific recipes to assist with specific issues.For example the Onion and Honey Medicine for coughs.It has all the necessary steps, ingrediants, and reasons to use those specific herbs.In fact of all of things, the list of herbs and the recipes are something that I will be taking away from the book and imparting it into my daily life.At the very end there is like a FAQ of what herb is best for what condition.Many of the answers have the sources directly embedded so a simple click will bring up scientific evidence on why that specific herb, or herb cocktail is useful.The fact that the author uses citations and just doesn't try to wing it makes me appreciate this information even more.Yes there are certain things that could be sourced, but overall this is a good book to have around if you use herbs in your daily life.The herb lists is a great and quick reference guide for when you have an issue and want to knock it out fast, be it the cold or the flu.As someone who loves black liquorice I was happy to see it has a herbal remedy, I never knew the specific properties, but when my stomach hurt I would chomp on some black liquroice and it would help.Same with Ginger, whenever I fly I have to take along ginger snaps because it is the only thing that will keep me from throwing up on take-off.Now I know a little more about their properties and why they have helped me.I am sure that everyone has that go to ingrediant, without even realizing that you are essentially \"self-medicating\".","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R397Q7YXEK6VQC","asin":{"original":"1544295782","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2016","date":{"date":"November 21, 2016","unix":1479690000},"name":"Wanne Williams","rating":5,"title":"Heal Faster , Cheaper and Safer","review":"Herbal Antivirals is avery informative book tat shows you how to properly prepare, dose and take these natural medicines yourself.This book must be in every house","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3HV0QDBPS40SF","asin":{"original":"1544295782","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2016","date":{"date":"August 10, 2016","unix":1470787200},"name":"Cynthia Muhammad","rating":4,"title":"I made a scrub out of this book,","review":"I made a scrub out of this book , gave it to my sister and coworker who had a cold and they recovered quickly","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RF99QVY5N0GSC","asin":{"original":"1544295782","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2016","date":{"date":"June 18, 2016","unix":1466208000},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"title":"Amazing home guide!","review":"Since the first book, Herbal Antibiotics, was such an enjoyable read, I snatched this book off of the digital shelves the moment it came up for Free!

She tells the dos and don'ts when using both types of medications, whether that be herbal or conventional, and advises what to avoid when suffering from viral infections.She provides so many different ideas for herbal antivirals. From cats claw which protects the immune system to betony which works to fight the influenza virus, you will find an herb that will help alleviate probably all of your viral diseases, to an extent of course. Very professional look and layout with so many resourceful graphs, pictures, and links to videos. The instructions are clear, and dosages are easy to follow. Tells you what to avoid if you are pregnant or suffering other illnesses.

That is extremely important because most of the books write about positive effects and don't mention side- effects.For example I didn’t know that cinnamon is not recommended for people who use blood thinning medication.It means that if you decide to use natural remedies you should consult the doctor or herbal therapist.for the right dosage.

In this book, she presents myriad new studies that corroborate what traditional herbalists have been teaching for centuries.This book is well-researched-- the author ACTUALLY cites her sources throughout the book.I enjoyed the kindle format for this book-- the hyperlinks to other chapters referenced within the book made for a much tiger experience than I would have gotten from a hard-copy book.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R24O5IQAQECL6Q","asin":{"original":"1544295782","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2016","date":{"date":"February 27, 2016","unix":1456534800},"name":"Morgyn Wade","rating":5,"title":"I never realized how many uses there were for some of the most common things in my kitchen like honey and cinnamon","review":"Wow! I never realized how many uses there were for some of the most common things in my kitchen like honey and cinnamon! After reading this book I am so excited to start trying all these different natural remedies! I found this book to be a perfect in-depth guide for learning more about herbal antivirals and the many plants and herbs available to us for home use. ! I've been through other home remedies books before, but found none of them were as detailed or backed by as much research as this one. I already had some knowledge of different options, such as zinc and peppermint, but had no idea how many different natural remedies were out there, or how effective some of them could really be. This book gave really easy to understand detailed breakdowns of each of the antiviral herbs, including dosage amounts and where to find them. The first half of the book was really informative as well, including lots of statistics and easy to understand charts. It was a helpful way for me to get up to date on all the research and studies that are out there right now and to be much better informed about the viruses that exist today. It'll be hard for me to justify going to the drug store next time I catch a cold now that I've got a great recipe for some cold and flu tea that I can make at home.

There is a significant amount of background/theory that a reader needs to be able to appreciate what is being said in this book.The most germane points in this book are something like:1. Amazon is not a neutral party in this. You can buy \"Mein Kampf,\" and books about bestiality... But Gd help you if you write an opinion piece about Covid.It's only because Elon Musk had something to say that Amazon backed down, but I wonder how many thousands of other people have things to say that don't get past the censors.2. Most cases are asymptomatic. (The figure that I have read elsewhere is 95%, but he did not present that amount in this broadside.)3. The risk of death is on the order of 1 out of 10,000 for people under 50, even those with chronic conditions.4. The risk of death for under 18s is something like one out of a million. (And this is only an estimate because there have been zero deaths under 18s out of 40 million people in California.)5. As far as the data shows, the number of deaths don't depend on lockdown in any degree. The age structure of your population as well as the percent in nursing homes seem to help a lot better with prediction--insofar is anything can be predicted.6. Earlier CDC and WHO manuals--as far back as 2006-- seem to concur that social distancing has very little evidence. It is only since the coronavirus hysteria that they have changed position.7. Earlier CDC papers --as far back as 2007--consider Coronavirus to be a category 2 illness. (By definition, less than 450,000 deaths.) But, for some reason the treatment that they recommend these days is as if it were a category 5 illness.8. Models are not evidence, and predictions are not data. It appears that the number of people that you estimate to die only depends on which model you choose.9. According to the data that this author passed, not only did the models used not predict the future... but they did not even explain the past.10. 1 out of 200 people in the United States lives in a nursing home, but they accounted for 40~50% of all Covid deaths. (If you get too strict with people in nursing homes, you might actually make the death rate worse.)Conclusion:Honestly, the book that describes the Coronavirus Hysteria is not going to be written probably for another 3~4 years -- it's going to take that long before people even figure out what is going on, with respect to overcounting / economic damage.That said, this book is a decent installment on the current situation.Verdict: Recommended at the second hand price within 60 days of this review. After that, the information will be much too dated.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1SJD0JHCNZWDQ","asin":{"original":"B08F7W9276","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2020","date":{"date":"December 27, 2020","unix":1609030800},"name":"Jonathon C.","rating":5,"title":"100%","review":"I wish I knew about this book before I did weeks of research on the pandemic and overreaction to it.

Governors must instead rely on fear and public pressure.” – from PART 2: UPDATE AND EXAMINATION OF LOCKDOWNS AS A STRATEGY“When there’s nowhere to go except grocery stores and Wal-Mart, many people will decide leaving their houses is not worth the trouble.” – from PART 2: UPDATE AND EXAMINATION OF LOCKDOWNS AS A STRATEGY“Unfortunately, coronavirus spreads most efficiently inside … “ – from PART 2: UPDATE AND EXAMINATION OF LOCKDOWNS AS A STRATEGYThis second installment of Alex Berenson’s critique of America’s reaction and approach to the COVID-19 pandemic is, as the title indicates, a critical examination of the strategy adopted by many governing authorities under pressure to do something – do anything, for God’s sake! – to flatten COVID spikes to save the lives of the elderly and reduce the pressure on hospital ICUs.As the author takes pains to argue, lockdowns fail because they’re based on theoretical models themselves proven to be faulty over time.In this installment, Alex introduces the reader to the concept of the “reproduction number” or “R”, which measures the number of individuals each newly infected person will in turn infect. For an epidemic not to spread, R must be 1 or less.Part 2 of UNREPORTED TRUTHS ABOUT COVID-19 AND LOCKDOWNS was written after the COVID spike of late spring and early summer but before the current spike of late fall and early winter now causing governors to declare draconian new lockdown measures. It remains to be seen if Berenson will comment further on the subject.One cannot fail but imagine the extent to which lockdowns damage the social fabric: loss of jobs and income, closure of businesses, suicides, divorce, and domestic violence. The media, slavishly promoting the default method to save the world, has failed to report extensively on the last three. Shame!Part 2 leaves the reader to consider the opinion stated in the 2006 paper “Disease Mitigation Measures in the Control of Pandemic Influenza” by Dr. Donald Henderson, who led the successful effort to eradicate smallpox:“Experience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted.”","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R18U6RX4ON5YE5","asin":{"original":"B08F7W9276","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2020","date":{"date":"November 16, 2020","unix":1605488400},"name":"Ryan D.

A few leaders are now opposing a second wave of lockdowns, noting the economic and human consequences that a person of average IQ predicted from the outset.Making a healthy population live like hermits instead of protecting the most vulnerable (hospitals, nursing homes) is backward. That’s why this pandemic has been as deadly as it has been. As Berenson stated in the first booklet, the median death age is around 70. Countries like Sweden and Japan, who didn’t lock down, show a similar case bell curve as those that did.All in all, Berenson shows why attempting to lock down a modern civilization (urbanized, globalized) creates such panic that people make terrible decisions, both lay people and policy makers alike. And full lock down measures are impossible, because people still need to interact to purchase food, work, etc. But “experts” knew this, they wrote about this, they just didn’t listen to reason. They just panicked, and the media is legitimizing their panic by bullying or shaming anyone that disagrees.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2Q888Z7AWRB62","asin":{"original":"B08F7W9276","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020","date":{"date":"November 4, 2020","unix":1604451600},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"title":"Brilliantly researched and unmasking the lies and pseudo science surrounding Covid 19","review":"There is a lot of misinformation about the current pandemic in the mainstream media and on social media.

Basically, the scientists panicked like the rest of us and threw their disciplined approach to policy recommendations out the window. The pamphlet could have covered much more ground, but this debacle will be studied for decades and it is just a pamphlet and priced accordingly. I recommend it, just don't expect to be overwhelmed by facts and figures, it makes broad arguments instead. I dinged it a star because the author phones in the section on lockdown impacts and I would have wanted some metrics.

Pretending that controlling a tiny trace gas in the atmosphere can prevent hurricanes, wildfires, car accidents, and “crossing guard” incompetence. as Winston Churchill stated regarding a different problem “we are entering a new dark age made more sinister by the perverted lights of science.”","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1QMQRDSMOO3I6","asin":{"original":"B08F7W9276","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020","date":{"date":"October 1, 2020","unix":1601510400},"name":"Jeremy","rating":5,"title":"Berenson does it again!","review":"Thoroughly researched and fact sited information.

First, this is not a “book” this is a 25-page pamphlet. I paid $5.99 for it, and I’m not happy about it. I’ll tell you why.In the first part of this pamphlet, the author sets up “science” as essentially being represented by some Ph.D. in Britain, who has questionable character, and because he has questionable character, “science” is questionable. Not that I’m a “science” fan, however, I’m certainly not a fan of this type of deception.The author then sets himself up as some kind of expert because Elon Musk re-tweeted some of his tweets. Let’s face it, Elon would re-tweet anything that would get people working again so he can make more money. The author then used number to re-tweets to increase his credibility, which could mean something, or not. So I read on.The author then writes that New York health-care system was never close to being overrun. But what about New York City’s health-care system? I guess we should ignore the refrigerated semi’s used to store corpses and mass burials? I live in the tristate region and lived through it. I'm sorry, but it was overrun.The author suggests looking at the deaths as “life-years lost” rather than just mortality. The suggestion is that it's harder to watch a 10-year-old die than a person who’s 88-years-old, further suggesting that it’s not that bad to let old people die. They’re closer to death anyway.The author pointed out in the beginning that the questionable scientist from Britain had a Ph.D. in physics, and not biology or virology, and I guess shouldn’t have been involved with virus policy. I find it pretty laughable that this author, having undergraduate degrees in history and economics, is writing this pamphlet and lecturing others on the virus and epidemic policy.The author’s motivations become clear by the end. He’s tired of sitting at home, he’s bored, and wants everything to go back to normal. The author is willing to accept the deaths of around 200,000 people so he can resume normalcy. Let’s face it, if he graduated college in 1994, then he’s about 48, meaning, he doesn’t have much to fear from the virus if he catches it, so why should he care? I’m saying this as a valid question.The thing is, after reading this pamphlet and some excerpts on the web about letting the virus “thin the herd,” I have to say that we have a problem, and it’s not the young people. The problem is us older people who raised them, and let’s face it, we may have done the best we could, but something went terribly wrong if young people's priority is to themselves and their gratification. I'm not saying I was any different when I was young growing up in the \"Me Generation.\" So please, learn from my mistakes.Covid has given us an opportunity to spend time with ourselves without usual daily distractions, by forcing us into a social and technological withdrawal, which many of us react to in different ways. We're being forced to spend time with ourselves, and this is an opportunity. Hard it's hard, but anything of value is hard.I just hope that young people, who share this author's perspective, don't have to look back on this time with denial or regret. Hopefully we come out of this with a renewed sense of ourselves, and realize how much distraction has taken us away from ourselves. I believe this time presents us with a significant benefit.I’ll close with this, taken from Wikipedia regarding the author: “many scientists state that he is drawing inappropriate conclusions from the research, primarily by inferring causation from correlation, as well as cherry picking data that fits his narrative, and falling victim to selection bias via his use of anecdotes to back up his assertions.\"I think the last paragraphs pretty much sums things up. I wish I would have read it before giving this guy $5.99.What I find truly incredible is how many people who have given this pamphlet5 stars. This is representative of societies having a predominance of people whoprimarily think emotionally, while being void of any kind of rationality. Not muchcritical thinking going on here, nor is there much kindness or consideration.---Follow up---Apparently Amazon gives refunds, and if the refund is taken in the form of “Amazon Store Credit,” you don’t have the send the pamphlet back. Remember to recycle!

I looked into contact tracing a few weeks ago and it seemed only the State of Louisiana was publishing actionable data.I suspect that bars, casual hook ups, various social events and even protests will be strongly implicated in our continued struggle to eliminate this virus as a major threat.However, it us much easier to pin the blame in political terms than human nature.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1A2Y74VQ7DZ2S","asin":{"original":"B08F7W9276","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2020","date":{"date":"September 9, 2020","unix":1599609600},"name":"robert basha","rating":1,"title":"He's trying to make up for his last failure","review":"I used this product to start my morning fire because that's all its good for.What i Disliked about this product is just about everything it entails, similar to his last book (which was a complete failure) Tell your children about marijuana dangers.He's clearly trying to redeem himself from his last disaster novel.The information in part 2 was a re-make of pieces from part one.Quite evident is the fact that he's taking important issues in today's society, belittling their importance for his own benefit (to sell books).Not cool, people are dying from this.He was an outspoken liberal, now he's appearing on fox news.He's flip-flopping for his own gain with a spineless approach.Wow, money buys morals.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R30TIWYN1XZOCM","asin":{"original":"B08F7W9276","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2020","date":{"date":"September 9, 2020","unix":1599609600},"name":"Holly Weston","rating":5,"title":"Facts","review":"Berenson cites facts to support his assessment that lockdowns cause society more harm than good.

If 1 million die from the virus, that is only .26 percent of the population. We gotta die sooner or later, and the majority of people dying are very old and have lived their life.

The booklet is based on a false premise; it claims: \"Based on the CDC’s scale, Sars-Cov-2 almost certainly should be classified as Category 2 epidemic.\" This is false. If you click on the link in the booklet, the CDC document says, \"This guidance introduces, for the first time, a Pandemic Severity Index in which the case fatality ratio (the proportion of deaths among clinically ill persons) serves as the critical driver for categorizing the severity of a pandemic.\" (p. 7) I've included a screenshot of the CDC Pandemic Severity Index. Now if you go back to Berenson's first booklet, it includes a link (I can't include links in my review) to the CDC's best estimate of the infection fatality ratio. The CDC's initial estimate of the IFR, which was cited by Berenson, was widely criticized by public health experts for underestimating the mortality, and in July, the CDC updated its estimate so that it represents the current consensus among epidemiologists. The CDC's Current Best Estimate of the infection fatality ratio for COVID-19 is 0.0065, which is 0.65% (see screenshot above). Below that, the CDC estimates that 40% of COVID-19 infections are asymptomatic. That means that the case fatality ratio is 1.08%. (IFR = CFR * proportion of symptomatic, i.e. clinically ill, people). Hence, the COVID-19 pandemic is a Category 4 pandemic, as the case fatality ratio for a Category 4 pandemic is 1.0-<2.0.Berenson’s defenders have claimed he’s right based on the death toll. But the CDC says 90,000-450,000 deaths for Category 2 “assumes 30% Illness Rate and Unmitigated Pandemic Without Interventions.” Nowhere near 30% of Americans have been clinically ill with COVID-19. For there to be a 30% illness rate in the US, that would mean over 100 million symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Plus, the US has implemented some mitigation measures (school closures, social distancing, mask mandates, lockdowns, etc). Again, the CDC said that the CFR “serves as the critical driver for categorizing the severity of a pandemic.” (p. 7)The CDC recommends widespread use of non-pharmaceutical interventions for a Category 4 pandemic. for example: \"prolonged (up to 12 weeks) dismissal of students and closure of childcare facilities during a severe influenza pandemic (Category 4 or Category 5).\" (p. 37)Hence, Berenson's entire booklet is based on the false premise that the COVID-19 pandemic is a Category 2 pandemic, when in fact, it is a [severe] Category 4 pandemic.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R31Y8ESEE37Q1X","asin":{"original":"B08F7W9276","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020","date":{"date":"August 11, 2020","unix":1597104000},"name":"L.

I appreciate that the author discussed school closures; however I am eager to read a more earnest and thorough discussion regarding the damage inflicted on the health of children due to school closures. Specifically, I would like to see a more direct comparison to the damage inflicted on society by the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 to the damage inflicted on children via a decrease in educational access.

The reason I bought this book because I want to find out the source and the intention behind the 5G roll out.There are only 3 statements about this in the whole book:- p. 60: \"ex-Illuminati insider turned whistle blower Ronald Bernard has told us, the Freemason project is to turn all humans into\"batteries\" which will energetically feed the despotic and lazy Nephilim families\"So this is the \"proof\" that the Illuminati is behind the 5G. And it does not explain how humans are turned into batteries.- p. 127: \"Most cell towers are built by Crown Castle\"There is no proof that Crown Castle is controlled by Illuminati.- p. 127: \"The small cells, the smart meters and the LED lighting used to conceal the 5G cells are built by Crown Agency Corp. subsidiary General Electric\"There is no proof that GE is owned by Illuminati.The nature of conspiracy theories is that they are unproven, so difficult to prove or disprove, but at least there should be some references to the sources. For example, the book \"Illuminati Unmasked\" has about 2000 footnotes.2. Errors in some basic knowledge of various subjects:- Habspburg, even though can be spelled as Hapsburg in the book, is the only spelling used by scholars.- p. 133: \"The Brotherhood spread the concept of Trinity to the ... Hindu (Brahma, Shiva and Krishna) ...\"The Trinity concept is a Western concept and has nothing to do with the Hindu Trimurti concept.It is Vishnu, not Krishna.- p. 133 \"... and Buddhist (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha)\"The Trinity concept has nothing to do with the Three Refuges because Dharma means the Teachings, not an person or entity.In the end, the author reveals that he is Christian who believes in God and therefore pro-life, but bashes Trump as a Rothschild puppet even though Trump has appointed conservative pro-life judges and the Trump administration criticized Soros and Rothschild.The author also bashes Biden/Harris as Nephilim puppets.So the author recommends voting for Tulsi Gabbard.So this is the author's recommendations to fight the Illuminati:- believe in God- vote for Tulsi Gabbard- stop shopping during Black Friday and Christmas so not to enrich the Rothschild family which according to the author has 100 Trillion dollars.Nothing much about the 5G Apocalypse in this book.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1ZNOX0B0H9BE4","asin":{"original":"B07V8M4B4L","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2020","date":{"date":"July 26, 2020","unix":1595721600},"name":"Alonso Luna","rating":5,"title":"AMAZING BOOK!!","review":"LOVED IT!!","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RBERPC6G6SSJC","asin":{"original":"B07V8M4B4L","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2020","date":{"date":"July 9, 2020","unix":1594252800},"name":"Jodi","rating":5,"title":"Excellent Book","review":"I've read several books on this topic and this book really helped fill in some holes.

Why keep looking?","review":"If you have wondered what your education has completely avoided teaching you, here are many many reliable answers. David has spent a good part of his life learning, researching and living this material without the hoodwinks on that most of us have.In front of the book is a Don McLean lyric: \"And now I understand what you tried to say to me. How you suffered for your sanity; How you tried to set them free; They would not listen;They did not know how. Perhaps they'll listen now.\"This is David's life as a \"messenger\" being mocked and abused for speaking this \"horrific\" truth. I got my first introduction in 2000 with \"The Biggest Secret.\" I did not want to believe this disturbing information but yet it resonated with my own experiences. I had seen the black magick spell over the American Dollar while in a deep meditative state. Something in it was evil, but I did not understand how. David's book gave all the disturbing details. I struggled to find a reason to NOT believe it, but the facts are there, and events in my own life were creepy enough to make me keep reading. This new \"Everything You Need\" book for me is easier to stomach in 2019. I guess 20 years of increasing evidence like the reptilian vertical eye slits in Barack Obama as he won the election in 2008 confirmed the dreadful truth David had laid out; our ELite are NOT humans. Princess Di kept telling us too. David says this book is a \"start not a finish\" to awaken us to a new reality that is raw, but true. From my own spiritual experiences I can verify that his understanding of the spiritual aspects of human nature are solid. The first chapters of the book on spirituality and energy should be required reading in every junior school.Our science and physics education is still frozen in the18th Century, but reading this book brings readers up to the quantum era and the inter-galactic space travel era that some already know exists. He exposes the hoaxes of false flags, global warming, the pedophilia trafficking, the vaccine genocides, GMO's, the Royals, the manufactured epidemics and the attempts to kill off 90% of our planet.He outlines desperate efforts of the cabal to stuff everything back into the box that they controlled before the Internet and the movie \"The Matrix\" opened up our awareness to what was really going on.

I’ve understood this for years but David gives illuminating specifics on how they do so.The only issue I have with the book is David’s confusion with interpretation of religion with spiritual insignt, that he calls “conscious awareness”.I believe they are one and the same.In general, Religion has misunderstood or distorted the message of life’s real purpose but through careful reading of scripture, the message David promotes is no different from that encouraged by scripture.Jesus was an example of infinite awareness, love and devoted His life to enlightening man to embrace a unifying nature that makes lasting peace possible.Why David does not make the connection is a mystery.Perhaps he has not considered adequately, separating religion from the true message of scripture.The great message of scriptureis to become aware of the necessity to learn and live the nature that makes unity and peace possible. This has to come from within through adjustment of priorities, values, morals, etc.Mans primal passions subvert enlightened unified nature as is evident in discord.No doubt, there are powers that seek to encourage and exploit divisiveness to control mankind.Scripture refers to this as satanic.The problem is, sensual man excuses and justifies his ignorance to indulge in debilitaive inward turning lusts.Until he becomes aware of this regressive inclinatiure and adjusts his balances accordingly, his fate will remain in the hands of tyrannical control freaks.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RQ4WVXR7LML9W","asin":{"original":"1527207269","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2019","date":{"date":"May 11, 2019","unix":1557532800},"name":"Blue Eyed Devil","rating":5,"title":"Possibly the most important book you will ever read","review":"Although I do not agree with everything David says, does or writes he has been way ahead of the curve and cuts right through the tripe and crap to get to the rotten core of the issue at hand.Our society is crashing in ruins.Intelligence and sanity has been replaced by ignorance and madness.

This is not by accident but by design and the plan is there for all to see if they only do some research.Cognitive dissidence causes most to throw out the obvious truth in favor of the approved narrative and David rubs your face in it.This book should be mandatory reading but unfortunately would trigger SJWs into a death spiral.Perhaps that would be best for all in the long run as if not now,surly by natural selection in short order.Think about that for two seconds.Two isolated islands.And it always strikes me as weird how any follower of the Abrahamic religions could question evil reptilians in the background.

I have RARELY, EVER done such a thing!TRUTH is very important to me and I do not want to read information from non-corroborated sources that are passed off as “absolute Truth”. Itherefore, in order to protect my “search for the truth”, had to toss this book in the trash, lest I interiorlize falsehoods and wild, unverifiableimaginings.

He would ponder a situation, consider his personal opinion on this subject, and then pass off his personal opinion as absolute, objective fact and he was wrong and wrong over and over again!I like David Icke very much as a person, but when it comes to factual truth, I have personally found him to be unverifiable and incorrect.Believe me, I was REALLY looking forward to reading this book and finding new, esoteric, and TRUE, information.

I actually agree with much of what he writes, and the rest I have an open mind about.Even if you agree with very little of what's in this book, Icke will make you think critically about a lot of things. I've had an open mind about the simulated reality/holographic universe idea since I read Michael Talbot's book years ago, but now I'm starting to lean more and more to believing that it's the most likely scenario.

Every now and then I poked my head out of the sand and asked myself, \"Why do thingsseem so OFF? Why do I see certain people and situations from a totally different perspective than everyone else? Why do I feel there's so much more than meets the eye...?\" At some point, I came across David Icke. I was intrigued, but most of the time (I'm ashamed to say) keeping my noggin in the sand was just, well, easier. More comfortable. At the same time that I was having this internal conflict, I was studying A Course in Miracles, a psycho-spiritual system of thought that has non-duality at its core. This too, I went back and forth on. By which I mean, I believed it to be true, but it was upsetting. So I would \"give it up\" (so to speak) for long periods. And then something always drove me back.This has gone on for forty years. I'm now 64, and I have to say, there is just no pretending for me anymore. I can't see the world the way most everyone else does. I mean, I CAN'T. It doesn't work. Once you begin to see, you can't unsee. It's like those books where you try to find Waldo. Once you've found the little bugger, your eyes go to the same spot and you just always know where he is. That said, in my opinion David Icke is a master at helping us see so we can actually find what we're looking for. I have total respect for the man, and I do believe he is bringing the truth to our doorstep. Even if you don't believe everything he says, there's a good bit of what he presents that is accurate and true. I know this. I can't help anyone else know this; it's come after 4 decades of soul searching.

It was created by evil men for evil purposes.” The EU has 28 member countries and 510 million citizens and is still looking to expand. She believes that Germany controls the EU and argues that because modern Germany was run by Nazi sympathizers after WW2, the EU is like Nazi Germany. Cohen describes the EU as “probably the most fascist organization ever created.” Cohen claims that it is obsessed with control and the result is endless rules and diminishing freedom. She describes a massive propaganda operation to hide the truth about the organization’s past and its objectives. She claims it is undemocratic and illiberal. She is convinced that the EU will eventually become an evil empire. Cohen is hostile to the EU and she can seem like a crackpot conspiracy theorist. Having lived in the EU it does not seem like a fascist state in the making.The book is targetted at a British audience, Cohen claims to be British. She wants Brexit to happen and accuses the U.S. of pressuring Britain to join the organization in the1960s. Apparently, JFK wanted a federal Europe. Cohen criticizes the BBC for its pro-EU propaganda and claims it has been bought by the EU. She believes that EU membership has been bad for Britain and provides numerous examples. She claims that the British establishment is dominated by neo-Nazis who don't care about democracy or the will of the people. It is true, that Britain’s difficulty in leaving the EU and the need to punish it for its disloyalty has left many Britons questioning whether the EU is a friend or an enemy.Cohen hates the EU with an irrational passion. The book is short and is more like a rant than a history book. It is disappointing that there are no footnotes. The book contains no biographical details about the author and a Google search provides no information.Most Americans don't see the EU as evil or as a threat. Cohen challenges the accepted view that the EU is a benign organization that promotes peace and freedom. Peter Hitchens (brother of Christopher) believes it shares pre-war Germany's obsession with Russia. Hitchens argues that the story of modern Europe has been one of geopolitical rivalry between Germany and Russia. He argues that the British have never grasped that Germany has always seen Russia as its main rival and biggest threat. The EU has expanded its territory up to the Russian border, this encroachment was encouraged by the U.S.There is an ideological elite in Brussels that is pushing for a federal Europe. Ivan Krastev, who writes for the New York Times, claims that the primary loyalty of Europe's elites is to the EU. They have more in common with each other than with their fellow countrymen. Peter Hitchens claims that “The EU is essentially a German empire.” Krastev believes the EU is trying to resurrect the Habsburg Empire, which controlled much of Europe before WW1.The EU has long been a bureaucratic rather than a military empire. It has common standards for everything, a common currency, a parliament, a central bank, a legal system and the free movement of people. It has its own flag and anthem and now has plans for its own army. It is starting to develop its own imperial ambitions. President Macron of France has recently indicated that he wants the EU to become a superpower to rival the US. Michael Portillo, who was Britain’s defense secretary, claims that many of the EU officials he worked with were anti-American.Cohen profiles forty EU founding fathers and claims that they were Nazi sympathizers. Konrad Adenauer was the chancellor of Germany from 1949-1963 and was one of the architects of the EU. Cohen claims Adenauer had Nazi sympathies. Adenauer did surround himself with competent people who were former Nazis. He claimed they were needed to rebuild Germany. Many industrialists, who had supported Hitler, were also brought in from the cold. The German government is currently investigating Nazi influence on the country's post-war central government and the report is due in 2020. The official narrative is that Adenauer had opposed the Nazis and was a hero. To his credit, the Germany that Adenauer created was very different from Hitler's Germany.Cohen maintains that the U.S. was never very serious about its de-Nazification program after WW2. This was probably motivated by pragmatism. A few high profile Nazis were executed in order to set an example. However, many former Nazis were rehabilitated because they were needed to rebuild Germany. The Soviet Union was threatening to invade Western Europe and the U.S. needed a strong Germany. In Iraq, Paul Bremer took the opposite approach. His stringent de-Baathification policy triggered an insurgency and the collapse of the economy. Perhaps forgiving and forgetting saved American lives in post-war Germany.Germany is the dominant economic power in the EU. Cohen claims this was always America's plan. After WW2, the U.S. wanted to build a new Europe led by Germany. It also wanted a strong federal Europe to stand up to the Soviet Union. However, the Germany of today is wary of anything that could be construed as a return to its past military ambitions.German military spending only accounts for 1.2% of its GDP while the U.S. wants it to spend at least 2%. A few years ago, German troops were forced to use broomsticks on a Nato exercise because they didn’t have enough guns. A recent poll showed that a majority of Germans are against providing military support to the U.S. if it were attacked. Polls show that the Germans are also reluctant to send troops to defend their EU neighbors. Cohen fails to acknowledge that an EU led by Germany probably won't become a military superpower. The Germans don’t seem to share Macron’s imperial vision for the EU. They want to be left in peace to grow their economy.The world view of the grandees in Brussels often differs from that of ordinary people. Donald Tusk, the former prime minister of Poland, and a current EU bigwig, recently said that ‘the world order of tomorrow is a world of empires.’ He also said that without EU membership, Britain would become a ‘second rate player’ unable to compete on the ‘battlefield’ between China, the U.S., and the EU.Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing President of the European Commission, has set out plans to make Europe militarily and economically independent of the U.S. He wants a federal Europe which is a military rival to Russia and the U.S. Guy Verhofstadt is a major figure in the European Parliament and a former Belgian prime minister. He has recently spoken of a pan-European empire and an EU army. He wants to expand the EU eastwards to the Volga River, which is east of Moscow. President Macron has indicated that he wants an EU army to protect Europe from China, Russia, and the U.S. The London Times has reported that Macron believes that NATO is brain dead and the EU must go it alone without the U.S.Many European countries don’t want to pay for an EU army and they still want the U.S. to protect them. Europe can rarely agree when military force should be used. It was split over the Balkans, Iraq, Libya, Georgia, and Ukraine. When Europe does take action, it is belated, limited, and usually divided. European countries have few core interests in common, so they are unlikely to be willing to die for the bureaucrats in Brussels. Five countries (Austria, Finland, Ireland, Malta, and Sweden) want to remain militarily neutral and will oppose an EU army. Only Britain and France have capable militaries, the rest spend the absolute minimum and struggle to appease the U.S. President Trump and Robert Gates (the former defense secretary of both Presidents Bush and Obama) have complained that EU countries are not spending enough on defense and U.S. taxpayers could lose patience and abandon NATO. Evil empires usually want to become militarily dominant.","verified_purchase":true}],"asin":"179796691X"},{"total_reviews":879,"stars_stat":{"1":"27%","2":"3%","3":"7%","4":"11%","5":"52%"},"result":[{"id":"R1PX4AB8P18EAC","asin":{"original":"B08CRZ9VZB","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2020","date":{"date":"December 27, 2020","unix":1609030800},"name":"Bruce Wayne","rating":5,"title":"Manual of the gods","review":"So much information in each chapter.

One of the Authors is Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum. The WEF was involved in “war gaming” a pandemic in 2019 called Event 201. “ Event 201 simulates an outbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic.” This book was published in June of 2020.Essentially, this book discusses the outcome of the Covid-19 pandemic and how the world will form into a new order a.k.a The Fourth Industrial Revolution or The Great Reset. The book is largely written in a hypothetical manner with suggestions as to possible outcomes, desirable or not desirable. However, it is easy to see it as a road map for the new global world order, because it is. Covid 19 has turned out to be a catalyst, underscoring deficiencies in our current system of governance, business, trade and social order. And the WEF (and their many powerful associates) has a solution for all of this. Interestingly, portions of this solution are already in place. Virtually everything you have experienced or read about for the last six months is part of their plan. This not theory, the ship has sailed and you are on it.I do not suggest that their plan is all doom and gloom. Their recommendations and theories are in fact quite sensible and I found myself agreeing with their descriptions of our glaring societal deficiencies and how Covid 19 highlighted them. Things such as universal health care, global warming, wealth distribution, supply chains, trade inequities etc. etc. are all discussed. Theoretically we could arrive in a post Covid 19 world in a better place, but that may take years. This book is fascinating and prescient (strangely so) and is a must read if you want to hypothecate regarding your own future. Do I trust them?…hell no. The devil is always in the details which are short in supply right now. But we are all going on this ride and that is a fact. Remember, Bill Gates said the next pandemic is coming and it will likely be worse than this one (yes he did and with a smile). So get ready and hang on.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3MJB6CN9PP4X0","asin":{"original":"B08CRZ9VZB","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020","date":{"date":"September 8, 2020","unix":1599523200},"name":"Jane/JohnB","rating":5,"title":"Every business owner must purchase","review":"This was a great read, and to get the most out of it, I did review certain sections a few times.

Americans want a government that represents the People, not a handful of oligarchs who rig the system to benefit themselves. America will be the greatest threat to the 'Great Reset' for this reason.In fact, saying that 'capitalism is broken' is pretty disingenuous when you consider that banks and corporations are the ones who broke it in the first place.Aren't we only 12 years removed from the 2008 financial crisis? And you think the people of America trust you to install 'global governance'? After our institutions have proved to be unworthy of our trust . . ?Private sector influence in the public sector is what caused our economic woes to begin with. I seriously doubt giving banks and corporations MORE of a role in government is going to benefit us in any way. I have a radical idea: let's get money OUT of politics, not invite more of it IN.I realize that most people don't have any economic sensibility whatsoever, but I think the WEF is underestimating the number of people who are raising eyebrows at this whole 'Great Reset' thing. Perhaps that's why radical revolutions so frequently entail locking up the educated. If you're somewhat intelligent, you see right through the lie. And so into the gulag you go! (Hopefully they have pizza in 21st century concentration camps. I need pizza.)All in all, I was not impressed with the book. I've been paying attention to the UN's Agenda 21/2030 for awhile, but I always thought they'd pull it off a lot more smoothly than they are. As it stands right now, a lot of people are viewing this as a plot to subvert American democracy. The question is: Why isn't this big news?","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R398M949RMHSEA","asin":{"original":"B08CRZ9VZB","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2020","date":{"date":"August 27, 2020","unix":1598486400},"name":"Vasanth Seshadri","rating":5,"title":"The best book so far about the post-pandemic landscape","review":"A lot of the articles we see that pass for Covid wisdom take the form of “Covid, therefore my pre-existing worldview”.

The UN Climate Panel itself stated, \"for most economic sectors, the impact of climate change will be small relative to the impacts of other drivers.\"Even agriculture is estimated by the UN's FAO to see grain production increase but just by a little less than it would have with no temperature rise (44% vs 41%).Politicians excel at making bold commitments not whetted in reality.New Zealand proclaimed a zero emission country by 2020 but failed to even reduce emissions.Not deterred, a predecessor has made similar commitments by 2050, promises that would cost 16% of GDP to just reach half of these ambitions.This is not unique to the Kiwis as Japan, Mexico and South Korea are all vastly missing their targets.The US was no where near meeting its obligations under the Paris Agreement even before the current administration's roll backs.China has tripled emissions since 2000.Even a complete rich world ban on emissions would not effect temperatures in the near term. Overall, the Paris Agreement would cost more $1 trillion / year to implement by 2030 and have a very muted impact on overall temperatures.And the one country who has reduced carbon emission the most, the US, did it with no adherence to the agreement as fracking natural gas has taken off.Its important to remember the effect of policies on the poor.The poorer classes in rich countries tend to live in more remote areas and must spend more of their income on fuel costs.Germany's energy costs have doubled over the past two decades as they have shifted to renewables.Insisting that developing countries do not develop seems cruel and unethical.This leads to the Schelling Conjecture: getting richer is probably better for the world's poor than focusing on emissions.Lomborg notes:Expanding immunization and curbing tuberculosis, improving access to modern contraception, ensuring betternutrition and more education, reducing energy poverty—all of these are well within our power and, if wefocused on them, could alleviate suffering for huge swaths of the world’s population right now.What should be done?We should tax emissions in line with Nordhaus' DICE model that balances economic growth and development with a muting of the worst case climate scenarios.That means a seven degree rise by 2100 at a cost of global GDP of 2.9% (noting GDP will be much larger at that point).We should avoid favoring certain renewables: the IEA estimates that by 2040 after $4 trillion has been spent, solar and wind will only account for 5% of global energy.We subsidize electric cars for about $10k per car yet get only $48 in carbon reduction (as measured by RGGI prices).Its also important to note that renewables could also mean wood which may be worse of the environment.We should understand the rebound effect: that certain efforts to save carbon by reducing consumption may mean we consume in other more carbon-intensive ways.We should adjust: both Bangladesh and Holland are vulnerable to flooding but the Dutch have mastered mitigation.Sea levels have already risen about a foot over the past 150 years.Coastal defenses such dikes, increasing sand on beaches, and things like NYC's sea walls and storm barriers protect coastline.Use of reservoirs and curtailing irrigation during droughts, air conditioning purchases in warming areas, removing wood near homes, and painting rooftops that significantly cool cities should all be done.We should invest in green technologies and geoengineering.This is where this book is at its most interesting and most speculative.Each dollar invested in green technology could avoid $11 of climate change.Each dollar invested in geoengineering could see $2,000 worth of gains.The list of ideas here are endlessly fascinating: emitting sulfur dioxide, storing energy in molten salt, creating new types of nuclear reactors, air capture, making clouds whiter and seawater spraying boats are all mentioned.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3NO42CM1DEDVI","asin":{"original":"1541647467","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2020","date":{"date":"August 5, 2020","unix":1596585600},"name":"Scott Hanneman","rating":5,"title":"Good","review":"very good","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1MTG38LTRKTYW","asin":{"original":"1541647467","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2020","date":{"date":"August 4, 2020","unix":1596499200},"name":"Rico","rating":5,"title":"Great follow-up book to Cool It","review":"Liked the data and analysis, would have liked to see more data on how Bjorn determined that MAN IS causing climate change.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2BX2PLQWKFZR8","asin":{"original":"1541647467","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2020","date":{"date":"August 2, 2020","unix":1596326400},"name":"Raghu Nathan","rating":4,"title":"A counter to the Earth's imminent demise","review":"Warnings on global warming have been rife since the beginning of the 1990s. Environmentalists have implored the world to switch to renewable energy alternatives. The issue has received widespread support from liberal western governments in the form of subsidies and tax breaks for renewable energy solutions. The environmental movement has supported it through sustained attacks on nuclear power, fossil fuels, and natural gas. The mainstream media have highlighted the urgency of implementing solar and wind energy solutions. Liberal-minded billionaires have promised financial backing through charitable trusts. Yet, after thirty years of activism, if we take stock of the role of solar and wind energy deployment around the world today, we find that they hardly deliver 1.1% of global energy needs. Even by 2040, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects less than 5% of global energy for solar and wind. So, how come the world did not adopt renewable energy more widely, given such a favorable environment? Is it because of a conspiracy by fossil fuel giants in preventing renewable alternatives from being implemented? Or is it because people do not understand the impending catastrophe, looming in the form of CO2 in the atmosphere? Or is it because the solar and wind energy solutions do not provide an alternative at an acceptable price? Author Bjorn Lomborg digs deep down into these questions and shows what is wrong with the entire climate change narrative.  The book argues its case in five sections. The first two sections examine the climate change orthodoxy, its pronouncements, the fear complex it creates, and what is wrong with it.Section 3 is on the fallacies of the approach in ‘fixing’ climate change. It shows why Green energy is a damp squib, why the Rio, Kyoto, and Paris accords fail, and how the Climate Policy hurts the poor. Section 4 is on the author’s prescriptions on how to ‘fix’ climate change, through innovation, carbon taxes, and traditional human adaptation. The last section is on making the world a better place by tackling other challenges equally important as climate change. Bjorn Lomborg is not a climate change denier, even though many environmentalists slam him so. He accepts that the world is warming. But he does not buy into the alarmist predictions of the future. He says that we need not resort to extreme measures of opting for zero GDP growth, not eating meat, abandoning coastal areas to live, or installing solar panels and wind turbines at an exponential rate to deal with it. Nor do we have to abandon the Earth and move to Mars. There are simpler and more rational methods to secure our future. Lomborg says the way forward is not through individual actions that reduce emissions because it will make little impact on the ground.This is because of the ‘rebound effect’ which offsets our emission gains. What is the rebound effect? When we do something like forgoing meat and becoming vegetarian to reduce carbon emissions, we save some cash by doing so. But we end up spending the savings in ways that lead to more emissions because we have the tendency to ‘reward’ ourselves for doing a good deed. This is the rebound effect. The author shows the fallacy of many common notions of such “good acts”. We can reduce food waste by buying less food, which will reduce the demand for food and produce less food, leading to less agricultural emissions. However, in a 2018 study in Norway, researchers found that people spend the money saved on goods, whose production emits much CO2 which more than offsets the original emissions. Similarly, walking instead of taking the trains in Europe emits more CO2! European trains aren’t big emitters whereas we spend the money saved by walking in products which emit CO2. However, car-pooling loses only 32% in the rebound effect. Research shows that overall, we lose 59% of emission savings from “virtuous” behavior to rebound effect. More interestingly, the book shows that ‘flight shaming’ achieves nothing substantial. Even if every single one of the 4.5 billion people flying in a year stayed on the ground and continued to do so till 2100, it will reduce global temperature rise only by 0.05ºF in 2100. Since “flight shaming” saves a lot of money, the rebound effect will be significant. The sensible thing is to focus on the carbon efficiency of airplanes. Similarly, the Environmental push to combat climate change via lower growth in advanced nations is short-sighted. Some even advise zero growth for rich nations. This will only mean slower growth for its trading partners in poor countries in Asia, Africa, and South/Central America. It will cause them to linger longer in poverty. Poverty makes them endure preventable diseases like malaria, diarrhea, and tuberculosis that much longer. The author says it is dumb to choose a ‘no growth pathway’ for the future as advocated by some groups. Instead, we must opt for a ‘high growth path’ by investing massively in education, health, and technology, especially for the world’s poorest. This will reduce poverty and increase human and social capital, which results in the push for a healthier and cleaner environment. Lomborg rightly believes in the power of Innovation and Human adaptation as two important ways of ‘fixing’ climate change. In 1967, Stanford scientists predicted that hundreds of millions will die in India in the 1970s because of over-population causing starvation. Norman Borlaug’s innovations in high-yielding grain varieties not only disproved it, but India is a food surplus nation now, despite the population multiplying 2.2 times. California did not solve the massive air pollution of the 1960s in Los Angeles by banning the use of cars. Instead, scientists invented catalytic converters which make today’s air much cleaner in LA despite the number of cars increasing many folds. Similarly, the Club of Rome report predicted the world’s supply of fossil fuel running out by the 1990s, but the shale revolution has given us a glut. The author shows many areas where innovation can deal with climate change without going to extreme measures.The other point the author emphasizes is the underestimation of the Human capacity for adapting to the environment. Science shows that sea levels have risen about a foot in the past 150 years. But we have adapted to it without even realizing it. People in Nijmegen in Holland and Houston, Texas have shown how to adapt even as they live in floodplains. People in Bangladesh and the east coast of India have adapted to severe tropical cyclones with various measures such that we see much less loss of life today. Californians have adapted well to forest fires in the past century. So, the author says we can adapt to a warming climate as well through many cooling approaches.I am largely in agreement with Bjorn Lomborg’s vision and prescriptions. I also do not believe that rational, factual arguments support climate change alarmism. However, I have also some differences with the author. One problem I have with the book is that it puts too much store by computer models of the future. First, it does not seriously question the climate computer models. Even though there are nearly 40 models in use, none of them agree with one another. Most predictions made in the 1990s on the warming of the Earth in the next twenty years have been wrong. When we use the models to work backward in time to see if its temperature computations of the past agree with the observed ones, they fail there too. The actual observed global temperatures in the first two decades of the twenty-first century have been much lower than the models’ predictions. The same is true about sea-level rises, intensity and the number of hurricanes, etc. The author uses other computer models which suggest that strong global action to reduce climate change would cause far more hunger and food insecurity. These models may be just as wrong as the climate models. History has shown us that long-term predictions for human societies invariably bomb because they do not adequately factor in the immense adaptive genius of human beings.Another issue I have is that the author does not seriously question the thesis of the CO2 as the principal actor in climate change. He accepts it as conclusive. So, he proposes ‘carbon taxes’ as one solution to “fix” climate change. As of today, over 40 countries worldwide have adopted some price on carbon. It is through direct taxes on fossil fuels or through a cap-and-trade program. These efforts have been in place since the early 1990s. However, most countries have found it difficult to implement them with prices that are high enough to induce deep reductions in carbon emissions. In Australia, they suspended efforts to increase carbon taxes after a backlash from voters. No one wanted rising energy prices. A similar backlash happened in France, too. As a result, carbon pricing has, so far, played only a subsidiary role in efforts to mitigate climate change. Not that the people are stupid. Rather, the arguments of the environmental movements on climate change have not convinced them.Yet another issue I have with the author is his benevolent view of Geoengineering solutions to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere. Environmentalists also regard this as a potential solution. I find this inconsistent and dishonest of the environment movement. Elsewhere, they oppose GMO products and cloning of animals because it is playing with Nature without understanding the consequences. How is Geoengineering any different? Throughout the book, author Lomborg says that we don’t understand well how the Earth’s climate works. Science has not conclusively established the “cause and effect” link between CO2 and global warming in the way alarmism projects it. Many scientists don’t agree with the UN panel’s orthodoxy on this question. In such a case, isn’t Geoengineering playing with Nature, if we suck vast quantities of CO2 out of the atmosphere? Can’t it have drastic consequences for plant life on Earth? Won’t the earth get a lot colder without its beneficial greenhouse effect?The salient characteristic of religions is that believers cannot question its dogmas. This is a difference between science and theology. If NASA says that they are sending a spacecraft to the Moon and that it will land at a certain point in Moon a few days later at a certain instant, it is a scientific statement for me because I have seen it happen repeatedly. But now, NASA says that they have a climate computer model and that it predicts the Earth’s average temperature could be 7.4ºF higher than today at the end of this century. I can only take it as a subjective opinion and not as a proven, hard fact. The environment movement, some scientists, and the liberal world insist that we must treat it as a proven fact. In pursuit of this, they attack anyone who disagrees as a ‘denier’. To me, this is getting close to being a dogma, pushing climate science closer to being a religion. We want it to remain Science.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RZ2F5QCZ340RI","asin":{"original":"1541647467","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2020","date":{"date":"July 31, 2020","unix":1596153600},"name":"glorybound9","rating":2,"title":"Footnotes truncated","review":"I wasn't able to read the Kindle version of this book as the footnotes were uselessly messed up.

Needless to say, this would amount to nothing globally. But personally, it would also be a terribly negative turn in her life, wasting away all of the previous efforts, passionate study, and the early success she accrued thus far. Yet under the right conditioning, having been sufficiently brainwashed into the alarmism, it is a perfectly rational decision to make if you truly believe the world will end before your natural life runs out.This personal anecdote is far from being the worst example of the harm that climate alarmism will cause us all. All over the western world, green \"protestors\" are blocking traffic, disrupting the daily lives of innocent civilians; in extreme cases even preventing ambulances and first responders from doing their jobs. Again, having sufficient faith in the axiom of the climate apocalypse, none of this behavior is irrational. Nothing can possibly trump saving the planet and all life on Earth.Next time you come across, say, an Extinction Rebel in England, try to tell them that not only the world is not going to end but also that by the end of the century it is likely that we will have eradicated abject poverty from the face of the Earth. Show them that the polar bear population has in fact increased and that the Northern Hemisphere now has more trees than it did 100 years ago. Ask them to join you in rejoicing over the bright future of mankind. What do you think would be their reaction? Shouts, screeches, and possibly violence would be their response, as a few Youtubers have demonstrated. Strange, is it not? For a group of people beating the drum of planetary salvation to be so hostile to the possibly bright outcome of our world.Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel prize laureate, described Bjorn's book as \"pollution of the mind\" in what he calls a review on Lomborg's work but to me seems a lot like a miserably failed hit piece. Notice the deeply orthodox religious language. Did it become normal now for Nobel prize holders to argue in such irrelevant terms as opposed to providing actual facts and data? By the way, if you are interested, Lomborg himself has posted a response to the criticism.Having watched many ofBjorn Lomborg's lectures and presentations, I understand that he is very hesitant to attribute malice instead of ignorance to people. But we see climate alarmists all over the world propping up children to follow the lead of Greta Thunberg, pumping them full of rage and hatred, cheering them on as they stop their education to scream at adults on the streets. We see the extremists openly calling for policies that would coerce the developing world into curbing their development, which would undoubtedly lead to lives lost. We see news anchors shaming women who decide to become mothers, accusing them of doing net harm to future humanity. This will lead to a culture of madness.How would you prove that the top proponents of this movement actually have good intentions? How to reconcile words and actions that are so far apart? The answer is that the green movement has now become a religious death cult that has all of the negative aspects of traditional religions but possesses none of their moral wisdom.

I found the prose to be clear and very well written. It’s an easy read and the paragraphs are short. The 16 paragraphs comprise 222 pages. What also makes this book of high quality is that the subject of climate change, and all of associated sub-topics, are well researched. The book strikes me as a professional work which Mr. Lomborg must have spent considerable time putting together. There are pages of notes for each chapter. An extensive bibliography is included and a well written index. The ease with which one can read the book made me want to read it cover to cover. However, the economic information and graphs were a little beyond my understanding.Mr. Lomborg was very bold in writing a book that goes directly against the climate change narrative. Surely, he has received tremendous “flack” from members of the anthropogenic global warming/climate change movement. He takes direct aim at the hypocrisy of the political leaders who signed the Paris Agreement and then did little or nothing to carry out the mandates. He also goes after the media and their false narratives regarding climate events and the associated political nonsense, which are really designed to sell advertising space and time. He points out the media’s intentions of pushing fear to the public in the guise of apocalyptic world scenarios, pending human extinction and the collapse of civilization. Mr. Lomborg mentions the deliberately misleading actions of climate campaigners and activists who are intimately connected to politicians with pockets bulging with money. Politicians who have their own agenda of seeking fame as world saviors battling climate change and, thereby, gain greater and greater political power.It is explained in the book (Chapter 6) that if everyone in the world did their part to reduce CO2 emissions, it would have little difference to global climate. This is a very bold statement that I haven’t seen in any other book dealing with climate change. In the same chapter, he comments on the statements of activists that couples should not have children as doing so causes great environmental damage. In Chapter 7, he states that solar and wind power are inefficient and provide little benefit to the world’s energy budget. Mr. Lomborg believes it is wrong for European and developed nations agencies to push solar and wind power on third world nations. He remarks that these are very expensive sources of energy. He also derides these political bodies for trying to prevent the same countries from obtaining cheap energy by burning fossil fuels – energy that could lift poor people out of poverty. In the book, Mr. Lomborg also mentions how disposing of the spent solar panels and wind turbines is becoming a very expensive and difficult task and will get more so in the future. Chapter 10 describes how climate change policy hurts the poor most. He successfully attacks many of the climate change myths.However, I could not give the book more than three stars. This is because, despite Mr. Lomborg’s very good explanations and views on climate change activism and the disinformation campaign, he still believes that man made CO2 is the cause of rapid global warming. Mr. Lomborg is an economist, and though he is highly respected and knowledgeable, he does not understand the science behind Earth’s weather and climate. His above viewpoint reflects this. He also believes that the majority of the CO2 in the atmosphere comes from the burning of fossil fuels. However, various well written books on the subject present data that, at most, anthropogenic CO2 comprises a small fraction of the volume of greenhouse gases. The climate forcing effect of this small amount of gas is not even recognizable on the Mauna Loa, Hawaii CO2 concentrations graphs. Mr. Lomborg states the UN IPCC climate reports are “the gold standard” and robust. I find it very hard to consider any author scientifically literate about climate change or unbiased if they base their knowledge on reports filled with ill-conceived and unrealistic climate models, data presented by authors who are not practicing in their fields of research and reports containing proven fraudulent information. I also find unreasonable his acceptance of a loss of Gross Domestic Product for a country in order to achieve, in some instances, a high level of carbon mitigation (i.e. reduction in fossil fuel consumption leading to less cheap electricity).His belief in instituting carbon taxes on each gallon of liquid fossil fuel or each pound of coal puts a tremendous financial burden on middle class citizens and crushes the stability of poor families. This tax only serves to put more money into the hands of governments worldwide and especially into the pockets of politicians – who dole it out to environmental organizations and climate change activists who support them! Mr. Lomborg considers geoengineering as a possible method of lessening or even eliminating global warming. Yet, this is an unproven technology. As he states, no one has performed a global scale experiment to see how much SO2 or fine ash would be needed to reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface, which would thereby reduce the generation of infrared radiation. Could scientists and technicians from a rich country even acquire enough of these two substances in order to inject them into the atmosphere in such a way that they would have the effect of sunlight reduction? Also, could they control the spread of this tremendously large mass of material such that it would have the desired effect? I doubt it. Global geoengineering is a fantasy of people who don’t really know what they are talking about.“False Alarm” could have been a great book.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1KB2BHZ0TGNMM","asin":{"original":"1541647467","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2020","date":{"date":"August 30, 2020","unix":1598745600},"name":"Motorguy","rating":5,"title":"All public officials should read this book.","review":"Dr. Lomborg is well known in the environmental community, and this book is about what one would expect of him, given what we know of his public position.

People are literally not having children because of it.These hordes of idiots are out there chanting and stomping their feet utterly convinced they're saving the world, while most of them should probably focus on much simpler tasks first. Bjorn Lomborg injects some common sense into this chaos. He presents several iron-clad arguments showing the reality behind many of the common distortions out there.He points out the media's compliance in all of this and it really is a shame that the current media is so atrocious because of their significant impact on peoples' opinions. Lomborg gives examples of where poor communities were pushed to have renewable sources of energy only to not be able to perform basic essentials that everyone in the West takes completely for granted. And this is the tragedy of it all...these policies are not just people wasting their time, they are actively destroying lives and diverting resources away from better causes.Lomborg encourages common sense and reasonable debates. He constantly mentions looking at both the pros and cons of situations and to keep things in context. Sounds easy, but this is far from what is happening today. Hopefully with more people like Lomborg (I'm thinking Alex Epstein) we can reach a more civilized level of debate and make some actual progress.One downside of this book is Lomborg's assumptions pertaining so far into the future. At some points it seems like he assumes we can finely dial in the temperature for 2100 as we wish. I find this hard to believe. Highly recommend though.

A calm call for action.The title of the book - and the rhetorics of the introductory chapters - merely seem designed to provoke the reader to 'STOP PANICKING!' And to be honest, I was slightly alarmed by this at first: My initial reaction was, 'Hey, this is serious! The ice caps are melting! Aren't we going to look at how bad things really are?! We need 'rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes' and we need them now!'But this book does not want you to look away from it all, as if climate change was just a false alarm. On the contrary, it wants you to take a good look at it to determine the likely impact of the changes coming - in order to see what we can do about it, and perhaps more importantly what not to do, which would only make things worse.So in that sense it is a call for a more sober debate on climate change. And I must admit that it has a calming effect to read it. It reads almost like some kind of a serenity prayer to make us ..- accept the things we cannot change: Yes, climate change is here, definitely. What we are experiencing now is only the beginning. But definitely not the beginning of the end.- have the courage to change the things we actually can change: We need to start changing the intellectual climate first. Yes, we need to adapt. As always. But we need to make clever decisions and to have a creative mindset to find lots of new solutions for all kinds of challenges, climate change being one of them. Panicking is perhaps the worst climate we face.- and hopefully to be granted the wisdom to know the difference: No, it will not be wise to try to turn climate change around. We can spend our resources in much better ways to do more good, especially for the poor.I highly recommend reading this book to reinstall our hope in our ability to actually make it!","verified_purchase":false}],"asin":"1541647467"},{"total_reviews":215,"stars_stat":{"1":"1%","2":"1%","3":"3%","4":"13%","5":"82%"},"result":[{"id":"R3N6YRMMKZ946Y","asin":{"original":"B00NMRPUQW","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020","date":{"date":"November 30, 2020","unix":1606698000},"name":"Kindle Customer","rating":5,"title":"Read it.","review":"A bit outdated but basic premises are sound.

I recommend to anyone who still believes modern medicine is infallible and that medical doctors are scientists. Some of the things he describes in the book my family members and family friends have experienced, and I’ve heard a few other first hand accounts of people who’ve barely survived treatment from modern medicine. I like the way Dr. Coleman writes. He uses clear concise language that anyone can understand. He breaks down complicated topics so that those without a medical degree or even any type of higher education should be able to understand. He has excellent skills of logic and is very good at making a point and then backing it up with examples. The way he breaks things up into sections makes what could be an overwhelming amount of information much easier to digest. He backs up his claims with numbers and gives examples of where he read something, such as which journal or organization it’s from. I find him to be very credible and most of what he says rings true though there may be a few things he says I might question a little. But we should always question the things we read to a certain extent, and learning should encourage us to ask more questions. I really admire Dr. Coleman for dedicating his life’s work to telling the truth even at his own personal expense and having the integrity to stand up to injustice no matter the personal costs. I watched a video of him on You Tube and should mention that while reading this,you should imagine a distinguished elderly gentleman speaking in a British accent.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3K6AL9ICEMUYM","asin":{"original":"B00NMRPUQW","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2014","date":{"date":"December 3, 2014","unix":1417568400},"name":"W.G.

I believe it becomes more important every year as medical standards slip. His twelve laws could be printed on just a couple pages but he provides many useful examples to prove his laws.Even to those of us who have seen first hand how medical practitioners and nurses really behave with patients under stress, many of Dr. Coleman's facts come as a shock. But they ring true and sound realistic, especially after reading Dr. Coleman's life story, as a professional Hell raiser and whistle blower. He doesn't provide references, except for his years of medical experience and research.Most shocking to many people will be the government collusion and incompetence, which goes hand in hand with the medical colleges' tactics of suppressing dissent and protecting their own. The media does not come out very clean either after this in-depth analysis. We already know about the lack of morality of the drug companies, but I didn't know that many vaccines and drugs have NO safety test on record. And that drugs for babies are tested on adults and animals. The facts on food safety are nauseating and disgusting.It's too bad that this book isn't part of everyone's education. Many who are still healthy wouldn't think of reading something scary. In a free country, it's our choice.

I strongly recommend this one because it's very relevant right now.

She was off by 11 years.Browne rose to fame in part because of her frequent appearances on the Montel Williams Show between 1991 and 2008, where she would claim to speak to the dead and offer information about missing people.One of her most infamous predictions came in 2004, when she told Louwana Miller, the mother of Amanda Berry, that her kidnapped daughter was dead.“She’s not alive, honey,” Browne said at the time, according to NBC affiliate WKYC’s report on the segment. “Your daughter’s not the kind who wouldn’t call.”In May, it was discovered that Berry was still alive and had been held captive by Ariel Castro for nearly a decade. Miller died in 2006 and was not alive to hear the good news — or the news that she was exploited by Browne.Browne responded to media questions with a prepared statement that included this line: “Only God is right all the time.”Although Browne claimed to have a psychic success rate between 87-to-90 percent, a 2010 analysis of of 115 predictions she made on “The Montel Williams Show” by Skeptical Inquirer magazine put her success rate at zero.In some cases, she charged a police department $400 for her services.In 2002, Browne told the parents of missing 11-year-old Shawn Hornbeck on the Montel Williams Show that the child was dead and kidnapped by a dark-skinned man with dreadlocks.Hornbeck was found alive in 2007 and his accused kidnapper, Michael Devlin, was Caucasian and short-haired. Hornbeck’s stepfather, Craig Akers, told Anderson Cooper that Browne offered to do a more extensive psychic reading off-camera for $700. She denied the claim.When she was asked about her inaccurate prediction, she responded with the same sentence, “Only God is right all the time.”Browne’s behavior was criticized by many, including The Amazing Kreskin, a mentalist who has done hundreds of performance art shows similar to magic for more than 40 years.Kreskin said he has helped the police with 84 crime cases, but acknowledges that he was only helpful one-third of the time.“I can help potential witnesses uncover information they didn’t realize they had,” Kreskin told The Huffington Post in May.He also said that any mentalist, psychic or medium who suggests someone is dead without physical evidence is on shaky ethical ground.“It’s the height of irresponsibility and it indirectly aids the criminal because the people who believe the psychic may have less of a reason to continue to search for the victim,” he said.Failed predictions weren’t Browne’s only legacy. In 1992, she and her then husband, Kenzil Dalzell Brown, were indicted on several charges of investment fraud and grand theft.She eventually pleaded no contest to securities fraud and was indicted on grand larceny.D.J. Grothe, of the James Randi Educational Foundation, an organization that works to stop paranormal and pseudoscientific frauds, has long criticized Browne’s activities, but sent out condolences to her family.“No one celebrates her death, but skeptics do criticize how she lived. Her dismal track record at predictions — she confidently predicted she would die at 88, not 77, for instance — would only be laughable if they did not hurt so many people,” he said by email. “The number of people she hurt with her pretend supernatural abilities is nearly as high as the number of her failed predictions. It is sad that it took death to stop Sylvia Browne.”Psychic Craig Weiler said Browne’s memory in his community will have mixed reviews.“Some of the people in the intellectual community who lean toward the psychic side of things did not think much of her,” he told HuffPost. “But in order for a psychic to rise to the level of fame she did, they have to be good. In the beginning, she had to be good enough to distinguish herself from the others.“That said, people are complicated. Skeptics aren’t all evil and she’s not all good.”","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1BG7IGP25TNAM","asin":{"original":"B003CUDOXA","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2020","date":{"date":"March 22, 2020","unix":1584838800},"name":"Richard K Myers","rating":1,"title":"She stole the corona prophecy from 30 years before","review":"Everyone is saying she predicted the Coronavirus outbreak.

If you can see the truth before you then you got bigger issues seeking people to foretell you the future and writing such nonsense to deceive many for money.You are better off buying a bible reading it and comparing the truth with current events that have been foretold way before any human beingdreams of false prophecies.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RCGNSHHRIUZZZ","asin":{"original":"B003CUDOXA","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2020","date":{"date":"March 25, 2020","unix":1585098000},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":1,"title":"300 Pages of BS","review":"300 Pages of BS!!!","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3239WYE99YXW1","asin":{"original":"B003CUDOXA","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2020","date":{"date":"March 25, 2020","unix":1585098000},"name":"J.

She said, “In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes … \"(Chapter 7).Her predictions about this global illness are compelling. She also predicted in “2020 for a sitting president to die of a heart attack.” Hmmmm. If you’ve read any of Browne’s other books, you’ll know about her spirit guide Francine. In this book, Browne focuses on the spiritual growth and not the doomsday, apocalyptic stories that have dominated. You’ll find a lot of historical and religious information across all cultures. But the best are the final chapters 7 and 8 where she reveals her gifts and insights. I read this book nearly straight through, it's that good. Take this journey with her if you are curious about learning some new perspectives and growing your spirit. Browne sees the end of days as our true “beginning.”Paula Cappa is an avid book reviewer and an award-winning supernatural mystery author.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3NAXB97UHTMX4","asin":{"original":"B003CUDOXA","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2020","date":{"date":"March 14, 2020","unix":1584147600},"name":"Catherine King","rating":5,"title":"Thought provoking read","review":"All I can say at this time while digesting the content is WOW.I have a lot to think about for sure.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R3D50E8LTCPHOZ","asin":{"original":"B003CUDOXA","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2020","date":{"date":"March 13, 2020","unix":1584061200},"name":"Deni rn","rating":1,"title":"more coronavirus price gauging","review":"Its laughable to see the price of this book.

Browne takes a realistic look at the end of days and what we can expect.The novel starts with Browne examining some ancient beliefs of the end of the world. She talks about what Christianity says, looking at the rapture, as well as other cultures including the Mayans and Aztecs. Her studies of the various religions and cultures are interesting and informative. Her look at Catholicism and its approach to the end of days is worth reading just for that. Her background and insights on Father Pio gives the reader pause to think.Bowne then dives into what various prophets have said about the end of the world. She looks at prophets who include Edgar Cayce, Helena Blavatsky, HG Wells, Nostradamus, and even Grigori Rasputin. What I enjoyed about this section is that Browne takes a compact look at these people giving just enough background to pique the reader's interest and sum up their accomplishments.One of the most unsettling topics Browne addresses is doomsday prophets. She discusses several modern day doomsday cults that have taken religious writing and twisted it to fit their own warped agenda. This topic is very informative in what to look out for regarding these types of people who use the Bible for their own warped purposes.Lastly, Browne shares what she believes to be the end of days through her psychic vision. Her thoughts are not what you'd expect, and she discusses such topics as medical advances, unusual weather, and reincarnation. Her thoughts are fascinating, making the reader think about their own mortality and the legacy they will leave behind.Browne's writing is crisp, engaging, and with a topic like the end of days, will hold the reader's attention throughout. Browne's done her research and it shows. Though psychic, she gives an honest account of past doomsday scenarios and why they haven't worked. As she accurately points out in Matthew 24:36: \"The day and hour no ones knows, not even the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.\"\"End of Days\" is raw, gritty, and fresh. By taking a look at our past, can we hope to make change for our future. This is a book that will sate the reader's natural curiosity about the end of days and offers hope. \"End of Days\" is another enjoyable read from Sylvia Browne.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R3I36P4AEVZTW1","asin":{"original":"B003CUDOXA","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2010","date":{"date":"November 18, 2010","unix":1290042000},"name":"Joseph C.

Reading her books is a way to listen to her voice again. Now, I don't necessarily agree with all of Sylvia's beliefs but I do like to read what the future holds. She doesn't write about future celebrity marriages, divorces, or babies, etc. She does write about our world including the Vatican and the U.S. government. She worries about North Korea more so than any other country. Anyway, her book also offers an inciteful historic backgrounds of the major religions broken down and their explanation to the end of days and other groups and even cults' image of the end of days.Whether or not we believe the end of days is upon us. I do have some criticism about Sylvia's beliefs. For example, I don't believe everything is black and white entities as Sylvia does. There is a gray entity that brings the two together. I also believe that we live hundreds of times rather than a few dozen. I also disagree that we plan out paths on earth. Believe me, I wouldn't have planned this life as it is. No, our lives are randomly processed. We don't plan on the other side who we meet up with or what features. Everything is done randomly like the lottery and it's best that way because we are always given a fresh role in a new life to learn and be better people.Now if I planned my own life on the other side, I think I would want an easier life so I don't believe that I planned it out this way. I know that I couldn't have planned my life this way and I wouldn't if I was given the opportunity. Am I unhappy, yes in some parts but that's only natural. Wouldn't we all want to come back ready and willing to make the earth a better place for all of God's creatures. That's my little rant! I hope and I know Sylvia understands to disagree with her. Yes, I know our lives are learning places but I honestly don't think I signed up in heaven to have this kind of life. I see too much misery and unhappiness that I know that most people would have planned better for themselves.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1A0OE951S8ZBO","asin":{"original":"B003CUDOXA","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2010","date":{"date":"April 18, 2010","unix":1271548800},"name":"Some Guy","rating":5,"title":"Good Read","review":"Some of the past reviewers have done an excellent job with writing an in-depth review so in the interest of brevity, I am only going to mention a few things.

Since tension has been up lately about the end of the world, seeing how often end of the world prophecies have been wrong will really ease a lot of minds.The last sections of the book are the author's own predictions about what is to come. The author is a well known psychic and spirit medium, you'll just have to decide if you believe in that stuff or not.

However, I thoroughly enjoyed all the history of people making predictions & none of them obviously coming true.That's interesting, but I'm too lazy to take the time to research it myself.The book accomplished what it was meant to & that was to get rid of fears about the world ending any time soon.Someone commented why in this book & her Prophecy book, she is vague about what year & which president that will have a heart attack.I think she knows specifically, but is concerned that saying anything will influence our decision about which candidate to vote for.I feel the same way about what she writes for suicide.Nothing in this world happens by accident, so if someone dies by suicide, that is the way that person is meant to die.But SB can't say that, b/c she will be blamed for encouraging suicide.The change in the anti christ confuses me a bit, however apathy does fit with the way she says the world will end. So at least in this book, it makes sense.There can be more than 1 anti christ in the world at the same time, but even so it would have been good for SB to state that.All in all, this books feels to me like she was writing it for people who have not read any of her books before.Those of us who have read her books are excited about our lives ending b/c we know the other side is so much better.But people who have not read her books may still be in the fear based organized religions, so naturally they are worried about their death & the end of the world.Which explains to me why she added the repeat stuff at the back.I'm very glad I ordered the book & it's one I will keep to refer back to every now & then.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R28BL41I37FBGT","asin":{"original":"B003CUDOXA","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2008","date":{"date":"July 6, 2008","unix":1215302400},"name":"Dr. Joseph S.

Whitney","rating":4,"title":"The shocking truth will protect you","review":"This book is an important manual for everyone that will end up in a hospital emergency ward or clinic one day, which includes most of us. It's the practical application of Coleman's Twelve Laws (which is another book) In other words, what should you do and how should you act when faced with health problems which you believe requires a doctor.For those who have never been seriously ill, Dr. Coleman's advice and his red flag title of the book may seem over the top. But Dr. Coleman is brutally honest and straightforward, telling you exactly what is going on behind the curtain.Although it's scary to learn, it could save your life one day and it is refreshing to read what appears to be the unvarnished truth. Coleman says medical doctors only want to give you drugs and surgeons only want to cut something out, These truths are very hard to come by because the professions, the government and the media all spin the truth to benefit their patrons - the drug industry. He backs these claims up with facts. You may have to overcome a huge sense of disbelief and futility before you can move on, so be warned. For example, the realty about the cancer \"industry\" is startling. It appears to be a failure of massive proportions.Dr Coleman advises you how to avoid sickness and disease before you get to the point of no return, covering heart disease, cancer, hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight and more - all the chief culprits. In 9 out of 10 cases, the body heals itself.You can and should stand up to any doctor or nurse that tries to bully you - and he explains how.The only complaint I have is that Dr. Coleman seems to be stuck in a 1960's time warp when it comes to nutrition. He missed the revolution somehow. He told us that doctors are taught in medical school that all you need to be healthy is to eat a healthy balanced diet, and he repeats this mantra often. He has a huge mountain of information to assimilate to become literate in modern \"alternative\" therapy. (which was mainstream only a short time ago) Like the fact that cancer patients are regularly given ascorbate by IV to kill all cancer cells in the blood and that natural vitamin E can dissolve fresh blood clots in the arteries, and that bipolar patients can be relieved of major depression by taking enough niacin (B3). His answer that food problems and meat cause most of the diseases plaguing mankind is way too simplistic and naive.

Mary Jones expertly portrays the extensive ways of how you can use herbal antibiotics in the place of normally prescribed medications, however, she advises that you first ask your doctor before self administering. She explains about the numerous viruses that can be preventable through the periodic use of natural antibiotics, and talks of the pros and cons when using herbs.Before reading this book, I wasn't really sure what natural antibiotics were, but I soon learned that even the most common household herbs have several different uses. From acne to kidney infections to bronchitis and IBS, you can find just about any natural remedy in this book. Sage can help with stomach pains, and elderberries can fight against the flu. This book provided me with insight on how dangerous synthetic antibiotics can be, but also explained that simple ingredients found in nature can fight against common ailments. Normally I have a hard time finding the proper instructions as to what herb and how much to take, but she clearly explained the proper dosages and how I could take the herbs. The book's content is qualitable and excellently descriptive, and showcases the use of graphs and handy video links. Very professional looking, it's not an amateur ebook. The recipes for natural remedies are quite splendid.Me and my daughter spent an afternoon making the elderberry chews, and I enjoyed learning about natural substitutions with my younger generation. A great read with answers to probably all of your natural antibiotic questions and this book will surely teach you a new home remedy or two, (maybe more!).","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R35JV7H2ZLYON6","asin":{"original":"1520779003","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2016","date":{"date":"June 14, 2016","unix":1465862400},"name":"Luke","rating":5,"title":"Helpful guide to natural remedies!","review":"I have always been in support of natural herbal remedies having been brought up in a Asian household with our share of traditional cures, though I often wonder the science behind the many herbs and spices being utilized.

The author has certainly done well to consolidate this information and provided a one-stop material for the curious or inquisitive reader to refer to.

This book has also laid out the steps on how conventional antibiotics are made which were very complex unlike herbal medicines that you can take in their simplest and natural form.I was also glad to find out that I am already taking a few of the powerful herbal antibiotics, that includes ginger which I use to prevent acid reflux but I will surely try out other natural remedies.

The instructions on dosage and application are clear and precise. For example, I never knew cranberries could help me with caries. I’m going to give that recipe a try.Why should you read this book and not another one on this topic? It’s actually pretty simple: this book does an excellent of summing up everything you need to know about herbal antibiotics, how to pick and use them to overcome your ailments. It’s going to be my go-to book when I need to reference ailments and the corresponding herbal antibiotic in the future.I highly recommend this book.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1MFBG06UYRR33","asin":{"original":"1520779003","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2016","date":{"date":"September 26, 2016","unix":1474848000},"name":"Fergiellis","rating":4,"title":"Four Stars","review":"Very helpful","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2V3KWE4ABNNJR","asin":{"original":"1520779003","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2016","date":{"date":"August 21, 2016","unix":1471737600},"name":"New Life Adventures","rating":1,"title":"Don't buy inkindle version!!!","review":"I bought the kindle version and the pages aren't even in the right order.

The author also explained a lot about bacterial infections, and common traditional medicinal treatments as well as common herbal treatments.The author was honest about the fact that people still need traditional medical treatments, but pointed out that herbal medicine and traditional medicine can complement one another.

The final data are on Wikipedia and in several scientific publications. The take-home message is a bit different than what Tommy Madison presents. On the ship, there were 3,711 people crowded more than residents of Hong Kong for more than two weeks (some for a month). The average age of the passengers was 68, and of the crew – 38 years old. No masks, no social distancing, no handwashing for many days. Only 696 (18% of 3,711) were positive in the RT PCR test for the virus, meaning 82% had some immunity that rejected the virus. Most probably, these persons had a previous infection with other coronaviruses that cause common cold symptoms.Out of the 696 persons positive for the virus, 410 (11% of 3,711 and 58% of testing positive) had some symptoms, mostly very mild flu-like symptoms. Only 31 patients (0.8% of 3,711) required hospitalization. Up to the end of April 2020, only 14 patients died (0.3% of 3,711), most of them over 80 years old with several co-morbidities.What is a COVID-19 case? In infectious diseases, a case is a patient with symptoms reporting to a doctor or a hospital. In newspeak, is a person testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in one of the over 100 molecular tests that received an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. It is well documented that 90% of the positive results in molecular tests may be false-positive.My take is that all the COVID-19 from the name of the virus (it should be named by the place it was found) to the statistics is damned lying only. The cases are only positive test results that may be 90% false-positives. The people with symptoms are tested by a molecular test for only one virus despite the fact that several different viruses and bacteria may cause these symptoms. The death count is based again on molecular test results and maybe 90% false-positive.The best term that is adequate for what we see is “Casedemic.”","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R2XJWVTT75Y9EX","asin":{"original":"B089WGRXXD","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2020","date":{"date":"September 18, 2020","unix":1600387200},"name":"Deborah R.

She is hardly qualified to review a book about an ICU during a pandemic even if she did graduate from a hospital school of nursing in NYC in 1968. I've been in nursing as long as she has, am a professor of nursing and medicine, and used to run a pediatric ICU in a teaching hospital. I've also been in the military in wartime. I've worked in public and private hospitals in Denver, Chicago, Boston, and WI. I've also been a patient in 3 different hospitals. I think Ms. Olczewski should be applauded for her courage and honesty.J.B. Handley's preface (15 facts about Covid-19) is thoroughly annotated with references from peer reviewed medical and scientific journals. I don't know how Ms. Edelstein missed the 70 footnotes in the first 59 pages. I would call those references evidence for the 15 facts.While the book could have used a good editor, and is at times difficult to read because of that, the story told is obviously told from a compassionate, though frustrated, point of view. All Edelstein's criticism (which boils down to \"Don't question the system!\") is addressed in the book. Erin Olczewski tried to alert her supervisors and everyone else she could think of to no avail before going undercover. I've had similar experiences in hospital systems, especially, public and university hospitals that answer to state government. And, after a terrible experience as a patient in a private rural hospital, I appealed to the Director of Nursing and the CEO regarding the patient care and system problems I experienced and witnessed. They didn't want to hear about it and were not interested in the help I offered. This is typical, I'm afraid. Systems are entrenched and bad employees are hard to get rid of. Doctors and nurses come in all stripes. If you're very ill and a patient in a hospital, especially, without an advocate, bad things can and do happen in the best of times. During a pandemic with a novel virus and the complicating factors of government mandates and financial incentives, is it so hard to believe that a bad situation would get worse?Medical and nursing education, in my view from the front lines, has deteriorated over the last 30 years. Even when I was teaching psych-mental health nursing in a university school of nursing back in the 80's and 90's, I was a rarity among my academic colleagues as a clinician who stressed clinical skills of assessment and critical thinking. Most of the other professors studied other nurses while I researched methods to decrease the suffering of pediatric ICU patients. I also taught in medical school, and my students were far from always the best and brightest. I have worked with med students, interns, and residents as well as corpsmen in the Navy. Some are team players and look to experienced nurses for help in clinical situations they are new to. Others are arrogant despite lack of clinical skills. Mistakes are made all the time, but MDs cover for each other. No one is held accountable.The biggest problem in clinical nursing is that supervisors and nursing administrators typically do not support the nurse on the front lines. Rather, they support their higher-ups (hospital admin, etc) by suppressing info from the front-lines about unsafe staffing, problem employees, etc. I was hired as a change agent, but rarely supported in bringing about needed change and better nursing care. My nurses would come in on their day off to be with a dying child or to discharge a patient they had worked with for weeks. I was told that, despite what was heralded as primary nursing (a primary nurse was assigned to every patient to minimize the number of staff patient and family had to deal with), these nurses should not expect to be paid for such work. They did it anyway. Those are the good nurses who save lives and make a difference every day but don't get the credit.As a patient a couple years ago, I had 2 nurses (out of about 20) like them over a week. The majority had no idea about pain control, the need for sleep, and infection control. The place was dirty. The NA's couldn't be bothered to even turn off IV alarms, etc. My so-called primary care doctor never came in, and 4 other doctors who didn't know me were in charge and contradicted each other daily. There was no communication among staff and less with me.I have seen first hand life-threatening mistakes described by the Undercover Nurse in this book. She had nothing to gain from writing an expose, and that was not her original intention. Her goal, from what I can tell from her video and this book, is to protect patients and to bring about change in a broken system made worse by stupid but arrogant politicians. It takes courage to do that. Whistleblowers are not treated kindly in the current culture, except for those with a political axe to grind.Reviewers like Edelstein are part of the problem. She should stick to reviewing vacuums.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RY9KPA97ND42Q","asin":{"original":"151076366X","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2020","date":{"date":"September 8, 2020","unix":1599523200},"name":"garni","rating":5,"title":"AMAZING BOOK","review":"Everyone needs to read this book.

This caring and courageous nurse travels from her home state to help out at a New York hospital during the Covid-19 crisis.After witnessing mismanagement and incompetence within the hospital as well as from the state government she felt the necessity to document what was being hidden from the general public. She documents the tragedy of patients that died needlessly through poor strategy and neglect. She also describes her heartfelt experience of holding the hand of awoman as she lay dying so that she wouldn't die alone, as families were not allowed. Her touching account of compassion brought tears to my eyes. Nurse Erin is no stranger to hardship and danger having served in the military in Iraq. She has been wounded in battle and has some disabilities to show for it. For her courageous telling of this story she has received both praise as well as scorn from the medical establishment and even death threats. She is not deterred.

The country was not prepared for a pandemic any more than Italy was prepared, as we all watched people dying in care facilities and at home during the surge in Italy. We know, for example, there have been terrible racial disparities. At the same time, nursing must be evidence-based, as should a book about care of patients. This is essential for credibility. Nowhere in this book are any references provided to back anything other than anecdotal claims.This book starts with a 50 page preface by JB Handley, an anti-vaccine friend of Erin's (as is her lawyer, Kevin Barry). Handley, a private-equity entrepreneur in private consumer companies, is not an expert on health care or COVID. The preface, according to Erin, is filled with \"FACTS\" e.g., “People infected with COVID-19 who are asymptomatic (which are most people) do NOT spread COVID-19.” and “Emerging science shows no spread of COVID-19 in the community.” Those statement have no scientific basis, are blatantly false and have been thoroughly debunked by David Gorski, MD, PhD on Science Based Medicine.Chapter 1 is a compelling memoir about Erin’s unhappy childhood with many photos. While this is relevant to ultimately working in nursing, it’s unclear how this is related to her description of events at Elmhurst.Chapter 2 is about Erin’s unhappy time in the military, where the government lied. As a veteran of the Vietnam Era, I have to say I found her description of how she was treated as an enlisted person to be very believable. I can't speak to her experiences in Iraq.Chapter 3 is all about how Erin became anti-vaccine “I'm not an anti-vaxxer, I'm an ex-vaxxer.\" touting her AV activism. In a chapter devoted to anti-vaccineactivism, her \"everything is about profits\" theme that informs her NYC 'expose' is presented. She also later doesn't see how her anti-vaccine activism is relevant. The fact the she spent an entire chapter in the same book on that activism makes it relevant.Chapter 4 finally brings us to NYC, halfway through the book. Erin went with an agenda, bragging about bringing spyglasses, for $10,000/week. As Erin often says, follow the money. Reading her descriptions makes it clear that Erin does not understand nursing education, medical education, COVID-19, NYC, chain of command, or HIPAA. Examples:Nursing education: Erin touts her experience as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), and explains the typical way to become a nurse is CNA->LPN->ADN->BSN (p152). It's not. She provides no evidence to support this theory. I have taught at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The majority of the thousands of nursing students I have had have not been CNAs or LPNs. Registered nursing has several levels of entry into practice, including the ADN, BSN, and Masters entry programs. We used to have hospital-based diploma programs. In fact, I’m a graduate of t the Bellevue School of Nursing (1968). The first nursing program in the country based on the Nightingale Plan, Bellevue was a diploma program at a hospital that is part of the NYC Health and Hospital System that Erin denounces. \"Most good nurses start out as CNAs,\" (p151) \"That's where it all begins for most nurses\" (p152) - neither is true - and then counts her CNA experience as nursing, which it's not, saying she has 18 years of experience (p269) when she has 3 years experience as a Registered Nurse. Erin became a Practical Nurse in 2014 and was not a registered nurse until 2017.Medical education: \"Most interns and residents have never even been at a patient's bedside before, never set foot into a patient's room-not to mention, they've never done so during a pandemic.\" Interns and residents have, indeed, worked with patients. Medical students start clinical rotations in their 3rd or 4th year, though many programs are starting in the first year. Erin never set foot into a patient's room during a pandemic before arriving at Elmhurst, either. She refers to interns, residents, and actual doctors, clearly not understanding that interns and residents ARE actual doctors.HIPAA: \"HIPAA includes a whistleblower provision that protects people like me who need to use examples of patient care to expose wrongdoing.\" (p244). Those protections are limited to an attorney, healthcare oversight agency or public health authority, and healthcare accreditation organization. Not only do these exceptions not apply to media interviews, courts have punished some whistleblowers for perceived carelessness with HIPAA protected PHI.Chain of command: I have to question why Erin hasn't complained to an appropriate agency. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals takes complaints seriously, as do Boards of Registered Nursing and Medical Boards. Those would be the appropriate agencies for filing complaints, where HIPAA protections for whistleblowers would apply, and real action to fix what Erin views as problems could be taken.Erin describes advocating for patients by trying to convince treating physicians to use Vitamin C, and touts zinc with hydroxychloroquine. I've watched the interview of her with the recorded conversation with an incredibly patient doctor. In the book, she refers to the doctor in Texas as using them successfully. That doctor is the same conspiracy theorist who believes in alien DNA andwomen's diseases are caused by sex with demons in dreams.On page 145, Erin describes PPE use when she took care of Ebola patients. The US had a total of 11 cases of Ebola in 2014, the year Erin was first licensed as an LPNin Wisconsin, where there were no cases of Ebola and an LPN would not have been in that ICU.. At the same time, she publicly posted a picture of herself working at Elmhurst in inappropriate PPE, including a mask with lips (photo included).On page 234 Erin claims a lawsuit by three Alabama nurses against the staffing agency paralleled her experience and quotes parts of the suit to support her own claims. I’ve read the lawsuit. The three nurses claimed they were misled and assigned to areas they were not qualified to work in and working in unsafe conditions e.g., lack of PPE. They did complain about working conditions which were, indeed, awful. At no time did they accuse colleagues of negligence, malpractice, or murder. They did not volunteer with the intent to spy on and mock their colleagues.One might argue Erin has tapes that prove her accusations. These have been the basis of HIPAA violation complaints against her. Like many anti-vaccine activists, much is taken out of context and/or misinterpreted. Nurse and doctor colleagues have had no opportunity to share their views, which may well be different and supported by documented fact. On page 212 Erin has a photo of someone at what looks like a nurses’ station with the caption “Doctor sleeps soundly after her decision not to code the thirty-seven year old patient who died.” We don’t know if this is a doctor whose patient just died, nor do we know if this was one of Erin’s patients. We haven’t heard the doctor’s side. This is not someone sleeping soundly. It’s someone hunched over a desk, head barely resting on a flat surface. Possibly sobbing. Even if this doctor decided not to code the patient, and may have had a good reason, why would Erin malign someone after such a trauma when on page 213 she has a photo of a nurse (we assume) apparently sleeping upright on a chair with the caption: “How could nurses stand up and fight for their patients at this level of exhaustion?”Most of Erin's premises can be debunked. As she herself notes, none of the people she worked with have had the opportunity to fact check or refute her claims. This is ultimately a book written by a conspiracy theorist paid $10,000/week plus expenses who intended to show the world how incompetent her fellow professionals were. She accused them, the hospital, and the governor of murder in order to increase her fame. While I was biased going in, I tried to read it with an open mind. Nonetheless, I was appalled at the lack of knowledge, ethics, and professionalism. In addition, Erin clearly didn't have an editor, which was badly needed. This is a fail on professionalism, ethics, and credibility.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1NYFT92SLAQKJ","asin":{"original":"151076366X","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2020","date":{"date":"August 29, 2020","unix":1598659200},"name":"Megan Browns","rating":5,"title":"Everyone needs to read this book","review":"I wish I could afford to buy 100 copies and send them to everyone who needs to hear this...both those who already know the truth and are searching for more, and those who need to WAKE UP!

I was elbows deep in covid during our surge and I truly question the authenticity of this Nurse’s experience and her motive for taking that travel assignment. The fact she was recording co-workers/patients without their consent really bothers me. Reading this book made me feel like the author has an agenda. Also, incorporating anti-vaccine nonsense into it, from someone who is supposed to be a healthcare professional, led this to read as a conspiracy theory novel. The language used shows the author has a lack of critical care/ICU experience, despite her effort to paint herself as “smarter” than her colleagues. As a nurse this book is harmful to our trusted profession.There are ways to report wrong-doing in the hospital, and writing a book and posting videos online is not one of them. If all of this book was really true MANY more nurses (and I’m sure physicians) would be speaking out. We all were doing our absolute best to manage covid patients during the surge, with limited knowledge about the disease.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R23XBL5PM4V4LG","asin":{"original":"151076366X","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2020","date":{"date":"October 18, 2020","unix":1602979200},"name":"Charlotte","rating":1,"title":"I was there too and she is lying","review":"As a nurse who also travelled to NYC during the corona crisis I can say first hand to not waste your time.Erin went up there with an agenda, she brought cameras and more. The rest of us who went there to help weren't even thinking like that.It was a terrible time, the hospitals did what they could with what they had. Was it perfect? Far from it.She chose to put her liscense on the line instead of following protocol and going up the chain of command, no nurse who values her liscense is going to risk it without trying everything else first. How do I know? Because I am one who has spoken out, without gaining fame, without having an agenda and mostly anonymously. Those who I worked with in the same wing spoke to the NY post and NY times, and it got attention to warrant an investigation into the conditions of the hospital. Did we need to violate hippa? Record and violate privacy of our patients and co workers? No.The florida BON (my home state as well) has very low tolerance for this sort of thing. Especially since she is not telling the truth, just pushing forward her agenda.If you want to know what it was really like talk to any other nurse who worked there. Don't know who we are? Because the thousands of us up there didn't do it for fame.If what she said was true she would not be one among thousands saying it. That's for damn sure.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R297W0GXS8DMGT","asin":{"original":"151076366X","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020","date":{"date":"October 16, 2020","unix":1602806400},"name":"Sam","rating":5,"title":"Truth. Bravely written. Must read.","review":"Every citizen over the age of 16 should read Undercover Epicenter Nurse cover to cover in order to bring another perspective to the current times we are living in and raise an eyebrow to the endless repetitive propaganda and mandates that have been imposed upon us worldwide. Thank God for this truth serum wake up call of a book and it’s writer for having the moral caliber and guts to publish it.Prefaced with J.B. Handley’s astounding summary of blood boiling real data and Covid-19 facts, Erin Marie Olszewski’s documentation of what was really happening within the hospital’s walls brings the ugly truth to light. Her honest disclosure reveals initial facility overwhelm that was compacted and overtaken by many healthcare mistakes, mismanagement, malpractice and gross negligence including situations that would be hard put not to be deemed outright patient murder in a non-bought court of law. If your loved one was put on a ventilator and or died in a healthcare setting “of Covid-19” please take care as you turn these pages. It is an overwhelming, eye opening and heart wrenching reality check that nonetheless in it’s reveal offers hope as it calls us all to see, hear and digest the real truth and take action. This nurse’s honest testament and the evidence provided by her and other healthcare whistleblowers must be investigated and judged in a fair, unbiased and unbought court of law as soon as possible so we can dismantle the current corrupt systems and uproot the many bad actors that have infiltrated our healthcare and politics. We must thoughtfully ferret out what works, prosecute the criminals and remove the practices and incentives that harm and kill patients while creating a new, truly healing and healthy healthcare system for our country.A must read meant to be shared.~ Regarding the harshest critics of this book, one must ask what their motivations are. What do they have to gain by encouraging others not to do their own investigation? I have found that truth tellers encourage others to do their own research, while liars threaten and dissuade others from even looking at something. Please note that one negative review was posted twice under 2 different accounts and under 2 different countries in order to deceptively be listed twice.This review in front of you now is written by a NYC resident of 20+ years with relatives and friends employed as nurses, workers and recruiters in healthcare both within NYC as well as just outside of the area. I immediately dove into Covid-19 research and was on exceptionally high alert regarding NY government, corporation and healthcare corruption. I have a residence only a 3 mile walk from Elmhurst Hospital and can easily bike to every hospital within the city limits. So there is/was a true possibility that someone I cared about or I myself could have ended up there. Many locals never wanted to go to Elmhurst even before covid. They would literally drive themselves to another hospital before allowing an ambulance to take them there, that’s how notorious Elmhurst Hospital already was.I highly recommend this book. I highly recommend we do our research and not blindly accept the scripted rhetoric the mainstream media or anyone else spews at us. Our health and our loved ones’ lives are worth it. And this is what this book is about. Look beyond the mantras, tag lines, tantrums and threats and do your own investigation. Get quiet and feel what really resonates even when you don’t want it to. It is your life, your health, your freedom to lose.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R1V1B419HHBKTL","asin":{"original":"151076366X","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2020","date":{"date":"December 19, 2020","unix":1608339600},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"title":"Great Book - A Must Read for Everyone who Wants/Needs to Know Robust Inside Baseball Knowledge","review":"The paper cover was partially ripped, which is irritating.Other than that, I have no issues or complaints about the product.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R35BH0IVJIUAD8","asin":{"original":"151076366X","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020","date":{"date":"December 15, 2020","unix":1607994000},"name":"Benjamin","rating":5,"title":"Hero","review":"Courage is often not recognized by the majority in the time of need.

Second, she admitted in her posts she was talking to producers and lawyers before setting foot in New York. Third, if you watch her video or read her posts you will see ignorance as a nurse along with discrepancies. She talks about people walking around everyday with oxygen around 88, and it’s normal and ok, in the video.She then states in the video that oxygen saturation should be above 90. Yes some people do walk around with an oxygen of 88, but they have lung problems. She also “advocated” for patients not to be placed on a vent yet was perfectly fine taking care of people on a CPAP or BiPap, which are both ventilators. On Facebook, she has called people “sheep” yet states calling people names is the worst argument. She states she was on the team that took Sadam Husain yet she was not. She states she flew a plane. She may have for a second but the photo op of her in the copilot seat tells me she did not take off nor land.

There are serious allegations of negligence, fraud and incompetence resulting in the death of patients.Nurse Olsweski who grew up in Wisconsin and has been involved in health care since she was 16 years old was working as a Nurse in Florida when the call went out for help in NY.She comes across as someone who wants to help and heal.Nurse Erin was assigned to Elmhurst where Covid 19 was rampant. She was recording co-workers conversations without their knowledge and the contents of the recordings are in this book. No names of co-workers or patients are mentioned but the stories are very disturbing. She paints a picture of mass confusion amongst the health care workers and deaths that should not have happened. I have always wanted to believe that when you are admitted to a Hospital, you are in good care attended by medical professionals who want to heal and do no harm. After reading this book I as well asyou may not feel as confident.Faced with a disease they never dealt with , understaffed, under protectedand lacking clear direction mistakes will inevitably be made. Nurse Erin describes Dentists and Optometrists giving orders regarding Ventilators and DNR's and CPR being conducted on a patient with a pulse .

She continues with her military experience onto her marriage & children and normal work in Florida. Then she goes to New York & Elmhurst Hospital, which is the second half of the book.

HandleyThis book is not for the faint-hearted.It is in some ways two books in one.Each one is compelling and explains much about the CoVID-19 pandemic – both the medical and the political aspects that have become inextricably intertwined and that have affected the lives of everyone.The Preface is written by J.B. Handley.This section is 43 pages long and includes 70 references presenting Handley’s masterful summary of 16 key FACTS about the CoVID-19 pandemic.During the five months now since my retirement from a 49-year career as a pediatrician, being pushed to a planned retirement suddenly due to the CoVID-19 related “shut-down” of the retirement home in which I live, I have invested an estimated 300 hours researching all things CoVID.I am familiar with many, if not most, of the sources from which Mr. Handley draws his conclusions, and consider them to be of a high degree of credibility and importance.Among the many aspects of CoVID-19 that have generated intense debate and controversy, with competing narratives from sometimes equally credible sounding sources, he in my estimation appropriately concludes among them the following:• The Infection Fatality Rate for CoVID-19 is somewhere between 0.07 and 0.20 percent, in line with seasonal influenza.• The risk of dying from CoVID-19 is very low among young and otherwise healthy individuals, but high among senior citizens and those with underlying chronic health problems.• Individuals who are infected but asymptomatic (which is by far the largest percentage), play a minimal role in spreading the virus.• Masks, especially the cloth masks that comprise the overwhelming majority of those worn by non- healthcare personnel, are ineffective in reducing transmission from asymptomatic individuals to others.The science overwhelmingly supports this conclusion.The opposing narrative rests primarily upon theoretical models and animal research, but actual data on transmission of the virus fails to support cloth mask wearing by asymptomatic individuals.• Societal “lock-downs” are unprecedented with past pandemics and are based purely upon theoretical modeling, most of which have proven to be famously wrong in the CoVID-19 pandemic.The seminal leaders in the modeling predictions have been disastrously wrong.• These lockdowns have proven to be ineffective in stopping the spread of the infection other than for brief periods in the early weeks of outbreaks in select high density populations where ‘flattening the curve” in order to mitigate overwhelming medical care systems at the onset.• Public health authorities and disease epidemiologists, by their own profession, do not consider negative societal consequences of lockdowns, and those “collateral damages” from ongoing or renewed lockdowns have already exceeded the harm from CoVID itself.These come in the form of deaths from suicides, drug addiction/overdose, increases in crime fostered by widespread social and economic disruption, etc.• “Phased re-openings” widely discussed and implemented for various sectors of the economy and the society are based once again, on theoretical modeling and are not based upon science.I would add an additional relevant point here:Many of the most contentious and controversial aspects of the pandemic have become interwoven in political considerations, financial vested interests (think new drugs and vaccines), power struggles, and following even disastrous consequences from well-intended but experience proven wrong ideas, defending these In the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.Examples of the latter would include continuing shut-downs, school closings, mandated mask wearing by asymptomatic, low-risk individuals, and political opposition to potentially effective therapies already used successfully (Hydroxychloroquine, especially when used early with zinc, and azithromycin).A parenthetical note:Mr. Handley, father of an autistic child, has written one of two books that I recommend for anyone wanting to learn more about the ever-growing threat of autism, contributing causal factors, and most importantly, things that one can do to reduce the risk of this affliction - How to End the Autism Epidemic (Chelsea Green 2018).The other is pediatrician Paul Thomas’ book The Vaccine Friendly Plan (Ballantine Books 2016), co-authored with Jennifer Margulis, Ph.D. These two books should be read by every parent or potential parent as well as pediatricians and family physicians who take care of children.The remainder of the book is a powerful, at times very difficult, sometimes “rough” sharing of a courageous nurse who has chosen to subject herself to great risk (political and professional) by becoming a Whistleblower.Hers is an inspiring, humbling, gripping, account of speaking out, stepping up and confronting unimaginable abuse of the professional ethic of being a physician or other medical professional that she observed first-hand and finally documented with recordings in the CoVID “epicenter” hospital in New York City.She relates personally observed and experienced abuse of medical ethics, while at the same time sharing some poignant, powerful accounts of her interactions with some of the victims of the nefarious practices she chronicles.One such description is so bittersweet and powerful that the reader cannot help but to find himself or herself weeping.As one reads through this extraordinary book, it is well to be aware that nurse Olszewski’s personal history includes that she served her country in Iraq in brutal wartime conditions and sustained injuries that have caused her permanent disabilities – yet when she encountered the abuses of power and of patients described in this book, she found herself impelled to accept significant personal risk in order to place attention and pressure on a medical system to confront its few “bad apples that spoil the barrel” (my analogy, not hers).Bose Ravenel, M.D., F.A.A.P. , Retired","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RZL3Y5MG0OSAD","asin":{"original":"151076366X","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2020","date":{"date":"August 19, 2020","unix":1597795200},"name":"Kristen","rating":5,"title":"Truth and bravery","review":"I preordered and was looking forward to reading the book after I saw her story on the news.

She wore a hidden camera. Nurses and doctors who worked with her have filed federal complaints, which are being investigated. She had no experience with critical care and had to be trained in many procedures while there. She didn’t go there to help people. She went to write a book full of lies about a hospital working its hardest during the biggest crisis of our lifetimes.She thinks she know better than critical care specialists and experts in pulmonary issues. It’s appalling that anyone takes her seriously. She even promotes the unproven and dangerous medical treatments that doctors repeatedly told her would harm patients. This book should earn its publishers a huge liable lawsuit from Elmhurst Hospital.Buyer beware. The book is 100% lies.

The author is incredibly illogical with his arguments and makes emotional pleas and derogatory comments to hide his inconsistencies.The amount of logical fallacies throughout this book is horrifying. Correlation is not causation, making fun of scientific studies doesn’t mean they aren’t true, making poorly backed claims about charities does not disrepute any good work done, an organization founded by both black and white people does not mean they cannot fight racism, an example of someone abusing the word ‘racism’ does not mean it does not exist, one success story does not mean there isn’t a problem, all in chapter 1 (I had to stop after that or I’d end up with a novel). His use of statistics is incredibly skewed – numbers can say anything you want them to if you omit or selectively choose what to report.One point I want to make very clear: focusing on white people killing black people is not invalidated by lack of focus on black people killing black people; arguing “I don’t hear you yelling about murder type A so you can’t be mad at murder type B” is a logical fallacy that serves to devalue life and excuse social responsibility (and is also the entire premise of this book).Theres an incredible amount of insulting comments about black people including a picture of a black man next to an ape in a suit while the author says he'd rather hang out with the ape. That's page 4 and it only gets worse.

I'm a black man, undergraduate student in technical college and transferred to University. I never blame on the white men era for my terrible childhood.

Let's fund George Floyd, but they take it way too far to the point where school and America culture will change dramatically until the quarantine is over. It will be censorship on your social media, youllyour job and they call you a racist and uncle tom, because your views don't matter to them. What's the point of equality, they want revenge.

This is not the book for the easily offended.I will say, however, that I skipped a number of pages, as he gives example after example of what amounts to the same evidence. It is quite sad that he can find virtually countless examples of tragedy, and he does his best to make that point hit home. It does. But all the tragedies have the same details, and he could have stopped at listing 4 instead of 24 examples.It is an easy read, despite the horrible accounts, and can be finished in a long weekend.

This book not only covers the victim mentality that is practically spoonfed nowadays to those who would exploit it, it exposes stories of good people within black communities that have been murdered by those exact \"victims,\" people who were not only not succumbing to a culture that can glorify criminality but even fighting against it and its perpetrators only to be murdered and then ignored to the point where in an era of \"say their names,\" theirs are simply just forgotten.When all that some white people see of black people on the news are often career criminals meeting what seems in some cases to just be a predictable end and then others looting, rioting and making people feel unsafe in their homes to protest, it draws an even bigger divide between us than there was before. No one takes Antifa seriously as a group with anything to say, but BLM has hijacked the image of the black community for many people who would otherwise most likely be more motivated to find out what they can do to make things better.This book is for the victims who any commonly decent person can have empathy for. While the title almost makes it seem like this is some alt-right angry take on BLM, it turns out that the author (first time reading his work) is not only a black man but also \"not a nerd\" as the forwarding author mentions jokingly. No one with any sense could call this man an Uncle Whatever for caring about decent people in his community enough to let their names be heard when all we seem to get to hear are the names of people who either had put themselves in positions that all lead to bigger discussions than just bad cops or flat-out hoaxers sometimes. This book is an awakening, not a forced narrative.Taleeb Starkes isn't only a great writer, he's a brave man who will surely be remembered as on the \"right side of history\" after all of the current media noise is seen exactly for what it is one day. Is there work to be done by whites if we're all going to share this country without the bitterness on both ends? Of course there is. But at this moment in history, that's an obvious statement, and even any virtue signaling white faker could write a book about their little journey of self discovery that makes them want to tell all whites to do better. This book, on the other hand, took guts. Guts inspire people of all colors to do better. This book is the kind of common sense that brings people together for a greater cause and not a fad.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RWIHBULNB9GFV","asin":{"original":"1523615915","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020","date":{"date":"November 9, 2020","unix":1604883600},"name":"Chelsea Inman","rating":1,"title":"Racist garbage.","review":"Racist propaganda.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"RI7B82X0HR8C3","asin":{"original":"1523615915","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2020","date":{"date":"November 4, 2020","unix":1604451600},"name":"Amazon Customer","rating":5,"title":"Exciting to know the whole truth.","review":"The truth is sooo.... refreshing.Complete exposure of the misrepresentation.","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"RELZR5OGE728M","asin":{"original":"1523615915","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2020","date":{"date":"October 29, 2020","unix":1603933200},"name":"Alisha","rating":5,"title":"Everyone should Read this Book","review":"This book was a huge eyeopener for me.

When we all can get real about what's really happening on the streets is when we all can learn to improve and do better.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R16OLGVAOZ8GXU","asin":{"original":"1523615915","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2020","date":{"date":"February 22, 2020","unix":1582333200},"name":"Happy Homemaker","rating":5,"title":"Thought provoking","review":"Filled with facts, true stories and statistics.

These opportunists are arsonists dressed as first responders, and their mission is to start racial infernos. In other words, they racialize not harmonize… One must understand that these ‘call to action’ reactions are not spontaneous. They’re calculated maneuvers promoted by an ever-present Race Grievance Industry (RGI), an industry whose only product is victimhood… The RGI’s sole purpose is to profit from racial strife under the guise of pursuing racial peace. Its modus operandi is rooted in a lie that refuses to die: blacks are permanent victims of racism and no amount of effort will overcome it… the message remains unchanged—America is a racist labyrinth specifically designed to stifle black advancement… Even when blacks are the majority population in cities such as Baltimore, and occupy key positions---mayor, city council, city council president, police chief, fire chief, school superintendent, etc.---the RGI still schemes to convince blacks that racism is America’s default setting.” (Pg. 1-2)He states that “For the last three and a half decades, blacks have accounted for more than half of America’s homicide victims, yet a group that literally calls itself ‘Black Lives Matter’ somehow didn’t care to exist until Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman. Evidently, not even one of those black-on-black deaths prior to Zimmerman/Martin was sufficient to start a ‘Black Lives Matter’ crusade. Furthermore, during the 503 days between Trayvon’s death and Zimmerman verdict, thousands of blacks were murdered, but their killers didn’t George Zimmerman’s pigmentation; they had George Jefferson’s pigmentation… Clearly, only a specific kind of black life matters to the BLM movement.” (Pg. 29-30)He asserts, “BLM’s affirmation that ‘All Black Lives Matter’ absolutely exemplifies the Hypocritical Oath. Clearly, its … motto doesn’t apply to the black lives turned into anti-matter by black thugs…. The qualified ones are blacks killed by whites. They’re the minority within a minority whose deaths will be praised and remembered more than their lives…The disqualified ones are blacks killed by blacks… Ultimately, disqualified blacks have to settle for anonymity and simple makeshift rituals (stuffed-animal memorials , and candlelight vigils) reserved for black-on-black homicide victims.” (Pg. 52-55)He argues, “If you watch the black press to learn about the state of affairs in the black community, you’ll be informed; if you believe the black press about the state of affairs in the black community, you’ll be misinformed. That’s because the black press---anchored by the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ)---is the official mouthpiece of the RGI, and thus only speaks on behalf of the ‘qualified.’ … In short, the NABJ places emphasis on everything black except black violence and criminality. Therefore, it practices the Hypocritical Oath… As far as black-on-black violence coverage, the black press is lackadaisical, yet holds the mainstream media to a standard that it doesn’t hold itself.” (Pg. 70)He contends, “The Congressional Black Caucus is the legislative arm of the RGI and represents roughly ten percent of the House of Representatives and about a fifth of the Democratic minority… the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) calls itself ‘the Conscience of Congress.’ Today, the ‘Conscience of Congress does nothing more than beat victimology into Congress’ head until Congress becomesunconscious.” (Pg. 89)He recalls, “Growing up in the inner city, I vividly remember ‘Cops and Robbers’ being our favorite pastime. The simplicity of the game---cops represented ‘good,’ criminals represented ‘bad’---reinforced the notion of law and order as a pillar of civilized society. Nowadays, the game of cops and robbers is played differently in the inner city; the robber is the protagonist while the cop is the antagonist. This backward dynamic is a reflection of police being treated as an occupying force while criminals are treated as allies, all because urban American generally views society as a racist quagmire.” (Pg. 120)He says, “Many say that America doesn’t have an official religion; I vehemently disagree! Presently, our seemingly state-sponsored religion is political correctness and anyone who doesn’t kneel before it will be publicly sacrificed… The RGI couldn’t effectively exist without this climate of political correctness. Today’s unchecked PC has shaped and sustained this current atmosphere where any criticism of the RGI is construed as racist. Consequently, the RGI has been free to impost its divisive agenda without significant pushback; inevitably causing race-relations to decay.” (Pg. 156)He concludes, “Although the RGI is sustained by its propaganda machine… legislative arm… and splinter groups… the three entities that actually give renewable life to the RGI are victimhood, white guilt, and political correctness. I refer to them as the ‘Unholy Trinity.’ And with liberalism as its ally, the RGI naively believes that it’s too big to fail… If we truly desire to become one nation under God, the grievance genie has to be placed back in its bottle and then sealed for eternity.” (Pg. 179)Obviously a polemical and controversial book, it will strongly attract and repel different readers; but is it a clear statement of Starkes’ positions, and documented by abundant Internet links.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R2B88LMTAJ1HX7","asin":{"original":"1523615915","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2020","date":{"date":"February 4, 2020","unix":1580778000},"name":"Kindle CustomerRaymond Schrock","rating":5,"title":"Read and learn","review":"This book is a lot of real truth.

The author simply cares about the facts and not feelings. Morality is color blind and as he said in a video, waiting until there are no more racists will mean waiting and waiting forever and no self-change is done. This is one of the most brilliant books I have ever read in my life and he uses accurate statistics to back up all of his facts. He really gets to the point that the NAACP/Black Lives Matter and other race grievance groups would rather continue to propagate \"systemic racism\" rather than what really holds a lot of African-American communities back. (Out of wedlock births, rampant crime in inner cities, dropout rates, victimology, etc.) He really cares about stopping the bleeding rather than putting a big bandage over it. He is not afraid to be politically incorrect and I applaud him! Every black person in America should read this book, and even if you're not black like me, still read it to learn about what the liberal news media won't always tell you. The race grievance industry knows that these facts don't support them so they want to continue to churn out lies to further divide this country. Taleeb Starkes goes right at them. Kwesi Mfume the NAACP president said 10 years ago that the biggest threat to Black America is not white racism but the huge absence of black fathers, that should be the cherry on the sundae there.","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R1425Z5CQYN616","asin":{"original":"1523615915","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2017","date":{"date":"September 12, 2017","unix":1505174400},"name":"Harry Deakins","rating":4,"title":"Four Stars","review":"Very good read","verified_purchase":false},{"id":"R2LTS5QFA3WEGK","asin":{"original":"1523615915","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2017","date":{"date":"September 6, 2017","unix":1504656000},"name":"BOB","rating":4,"title":"Very Interesting Insights","review":"Very Interesting Insights","verified_purchase":true},{"id":"R9S9UFSQZBNET","asin":{"original":"1523615915","variant":""},"review_data":"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2017","date":{"date":"September 6, 2017","unix":1504656000},"name":"MCR","rating":5,"title":"Highly recommend this work","review":"Outstanding book, written by someone dealing with the real problems on the streets.

Every hack demagogue, every con artist, every race hustler out there has gotten into the act. No one suffers more from this insane Religion of Hatred than the Black people themselves. A very fine talented writer, Taleeb Starkes highlights the glaring hypocrisy of the BLM movement and attending political parasites who feed off the misinformation and disinformation to gin up and exacerbate racial tensions.The worst thing you can be regarding this movement is ignorant. The tentacles of the BLM movement go far and deep. This is a very dangerous organization. Taleeb follows the money trail naming the Hollywood elites and others who are surreptitiously funneling money into this violent organization. The book also highlights the huge amount of Black on Black violence and murders. Most shocking and disturbing are how many young people are often the victims. Equally appalling is the complicity of Black politicians and leaders -up to and including the Black Congressional Caucus- all of whom have chosen to remain silent rather than take action to address the crises. Even after calls for intervention by their own local law enforcement people these Black ‘leaders’ fail to show up and take a stand with respect to black on black violence. There have been a few brave black voices to speak up and speak out but those that do are quickly shouted down, marginalized, and ignored.This is a very well written book packed with an abundance of facts and information. It’s the kind of book you want to pass on to your friends and family.

America is NOT a fraction as \"racist\" as many people (particularly blacks in positions of power AND the people behind the BLM) would like everyone to believe it is. Mr. Starkes thoughtfully and intelligently (and courageously) pointed out where the REAL problems lie during a time where racial tensions and discourse are worse than they have been since before the civil rights movement. He effectively explained how and why blacks in America are literally their own worst enemy and are, in the majority of cases, crying \"racism\" where none exists; much to their own detriment. And while the majority of blacks are violently demanding equality and inclusion, at the exact same timethey insist on having 'their own EVERYTHING', (i.e., BLACK history month, BET, United NEGRO College Fund, NAACP, #BLACK LIVES MATTER, and on and on) thereby excluding non-blacks from their organizations and socially segregating themselves in the process-all while blaming someone else; namely white people and law enforcement officers. I don't have a problem with people saying \"Black Lives Matter\", but I DO have a problem when the same people who are chanting that term are also stating that \"Cops' lives DON’T matter' and insisting that it's \"racist\" to say that \"All Lives Matter\". Just like we've all heard how offensive the \"N-word\" is to blacks, I am equally offended by the \"R-word\" (racist) and how frequently and casually that word is used to coerce silence and make non-blacks walk on eggshells for fear of being branded as such and then demonized. The author points out the hypocrisy of how a movement like BLM only marches, protests, riots and creates a dangerous (and often deadly) environment when a black person is killed by a white person or a police officer, yet when a black person (even a baby or young child) is killed by another black (perhaps killed by a stray bullet during a drive-by shooting) BLM is not seen or heard from. The author poses an excellent question: \"Do black lives only matter when their killer is white?\", while presenting the harrowing statistical facts that show the OVERWHELMING majority of blacks are killed by members of their own race; yet BLM and the black community are conspicuously silent...despite the fact that it occurs on a daily basis. A black man has twice been elected to the most powerful position in the world-President of the United States-but the RGI and BLM still contend that most white Americans are racist and that racism against blacks is still prevalent and on the rise in this country. Really??? If you look at the big picture honestly (as the author does) it is clear that blacks have just as many-and in some cases MORE-rights, privileges and opportunities as anyone else. Yet they still claim that they are 'oppressed' and blame society for their station in life; there is ZERO accountability for their actions and the consequences (i.e, being arrested for breaking the law or being shot or killed by police when they fail to comply with lawful orders-such as dropping the weapon in their hand; they already know the probable outcome of their actions but when they are shot and/or killed for doing so, they want everyone except the criminal held accountable) of those actions. I digress, however. I truly wish this book became required school reading for anyone and everyone from junior high school-aged kids and beyond because knowledge is power; and American society as a whole could GREATLY benefit from the eye-opening truths that are revealed in this book and then someday, perhaps, we could all exist in racial harmony with one another instead of fighting a generally one-sided war that will ultimately have no winner. (A note to the author: THANK YOU, Mr. Starkes, for having the courage and insight to risk speaking out against the status quo-though I realize that you will sadly not be celebrated as the honest, intelligent free-thinking individual that you are by members of your own race; but you can rest assured that you are celebrated and deeply respected by me & I will recommend this book to everyone I know. Thank you also for your dedication to the Truth. I wish you and yours all the best.

That doesn't mean that it's necessarily wrong, I'm just saying that the book is shockingly racist.And I think, the author does try to purposefully shock in order to convey his arguments - which is an abusive and forceful argumentative technique.Anyway, I do agree with some of the arguments in the book, a large part in fact. However, it's the logic behind the arguments that convinced me, not the overwhelming amount of racism.The book is full of facts and examples. I haven't done any fact checking but there is enough common sense to reach an acceptable degree of plausibility - as long as you can get past the racism.We do need to have a big and open discussion on the subject. However, attacking your opponent (instead, or even in addition, their arguments) doesn't lead to a peaceful resolution.This discussion needs to be conducted in a calm and impartial environment, and needs to be based purely on logic. We need to target the common good and well being, not people's emotions.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 2016-12-09So I write an honest review and I have 4 people attacking me in the comments for calling the book racist...

I'm sure it's on purpose, and I'm sure there is a lobby and a big financial interest behind it all, but what about the common people? Do you not talk to one another? Apparently not...You are just willing to believe whatever fake story you read on Facebook without an ounce of critical thinking... Yep, that's how Trump got elected.Oh, and guess what - the biggest source of fake anti-Clinton and pro-Trump news came from...... Ukraine!Yep, that's the same country that Russia invaded a year and a half ago... and just claimed that part of it.Oh, and the part that Russia claimed - Crimea, well that's their only military base in the Black Sea... You know, the waters neighboring Turkey, and very very close to the Middle East... that's where the US has been fighting wars for the past decade or two.... also where oil comes from.... $$$$I digress...
